Due to a planned Unite the Union strike at London Trams later this week, Transport for London (TfL) is advising customers to plan ahead, consider alternative routes, check before they travel and allow extra time to complete their journeys. Customers are advised to visit tfl.gov.uk/strikes for the latest information.

From Sunday 24 March until Thursday 28 March, Unite the Union members, who maintain the trams and infrastructure, are planning to strike that will impact the London Trams network. If the action goes ahead, there will be a reduced service expected on the whole of the London Trams network for some of these days.

Where possible, customers should consider walking and cycling for local journeys. London Buses and London Overground are expected to operate as normal but could be busier than usual.

Navid Golshan, General Manager for London Trams, said: "We urge Unite the Union to continue to work with us to find a resolution and call this strike off.  Customers planning to use London Trams services are urged to check before they travel, allow extra time for their journeys, and check the TfL website or the TfL Go app for the latest travel information."

TfL staff and Travel Ambassadors will be deployed on the busiest parts of the London Trams network to assist customers with their onward journeys.  These locations include Addington Village, Beckenham Junction, East Croydon, Elmers End, West Croydon and Wimbledon.

TfL is running a wide-ranging communications campaign to ensure customers are aware the strike action is taking place and to help minimise any inconvenience wherever possible.  This includes signposting customers to latest travel information via tfl.gov.uk/strikes or the TfL Go app.

Additionally, from the Friday 29 March to Wednesday 24 April there is a planned closure of the London Trams network for essential maintenance.  No trams will run from East Croydon to New Addington, Elmers End and Beckenham Junction but rail replacement bus services and enhanced local bus services will be available.
