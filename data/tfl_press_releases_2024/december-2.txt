 Transport for London refreshes staff uniforms with a new, brighter look
 
 18 December 2024
 
 


 

 
 The uniform, designed by HemingwayDesign and introduced in 2015, has been refreshed using new fabric technology and made more inclusive, with brighter colours and increased functionality for frontline staff
 
 




 "This new uniform brings all our TfL teams together, showing we are united in our work to help the millions of people who travel on our services to get across the city as quickly and smoothly as possible."
 
 Claire Mann
 TfL's Chief Operating Officer
 


 
New design will be rolled out across Transport for London (TfL), including the Elizabeth line and London Overground, starting with London Underground, the Lost Property Office, TfL Visitor Centres and the Docklands Light Railway (DLR) from December 2024
Transport for London (TfL) is refreshing the uniform that thousands of its staff wear across the network to help make staff more easily identifiable to customers, especially in busier stations.

The new look uniforms, that customers will start to see some staff wearing in the coming weeks, are a refresh of the uniform design first introduced in 2015 by HemingwayDesign. The refreshed design, supplied by uniform provider Cooneen, has brighter roundels representing each mode or team on the overcoat and fleecington jacket and on accessories such as hats, scarves and ties. The larger, brighter roundels will provide improved contrast and visibility - a key point in feedback on the current uniform design from visually impaired customers. Non-mode specific roundels will also be visible on other items, such as trousers and skirts. 

To make the uniform as inclusive as possible, TfL used staff feedback on the current uniform to inform the changes, which include using softer yet durable fabrics. The new viscose blend fabric in the trousers, shorts and skirts was chosen for its breathable qualities, while still draping well. The refreshed design has improved functionality to help all colleagues working across the network, including those experiencing common symptoms of Menopause, such as hot flushes and dry, itchy skin. Key garments help maintain warmth and have additional loops for essential kit. The refresh also makes certain items available to colleagues who require them, such as head scarves and vegan alternatives to leather belts and one of the shoe designs. 

Environmental sustainability has been considered throughout the refresh process. The contract requires that uniform deliveries must be consolidated, meaning fewer trips are made and thereby reducing congestion on the roads; and they must be delivered by zero-emission vehicles, further reducing the impact on the environment. TfL has ensured there is further movement towards more sustainable materials, starting with the jacket being made of 51 per cent recycled materials. By making these changes, the new uniform is also expected to have a financial benefit over the long-term.

As old uniforms come to the end of their working life, colleagues will have a 12-month transition period to move over to the new uniforms, and old uniforms will be recycled where possible.

Claire Mann, TfL's Chief Operating Officer, said: "This new uniform brings all our TfL teams together, showing we are united in our work to help the millions of people who travel on our services to get across the city as quickly and smoothly as possible. The new look will make it easier for those looking for assistance to find staff at our stations, while still continuing to have the professional look we expect.

"Introducing further diversity improvements through the uniforms, as well as ensuring they are designed to help staff at all phases of their life, is another way we are continuing to ensure our teams represent the city we serve while respecting TfL's renowned heritage." 

Brook Randall, Bus Station Controller for TfL, said: "The fabric felt breathable and not itchy! I like the colour because it will stand out in situations where operational colleagues are dealing with a difficult situation - so police, ambulance staff and the fire service can see us. I feel like a lot of effort, time and dedication has gone into this uniform to make it just right."  

Michael Roberts, Chief Executive at London TravelWatch, said: "Staff visibility is a key factor in ensuring people can access help and support when they are travelling, and we have previously highlighted how some passengers found it difficult to identify staff in their dark blue uniforms. The refreshed uniform design should make it easier to spot staff and we look forward to hearing how well the new kit is received by the public."

Neel Raura, Cooneen's Commercial Director, said: "Cooneen is honoured to continue our journey with Transport for London (TfL). As it has been from day one, it has been a pleasure to work collaboratively with the TfL team. We continue to be extremely excited and proud to work with such an iconic brand like TfL. 

"The new uniform is underpinned by the core areas of diversity & inclusion, sustainability and will make the TfL staff more visible. It was important for us, to take TfL's feedback onboard and the feedback from their customers to allow us to make the changes to the new uniform design. We will continue our ongoing work in research & development with TfL and we look forward to rolling out their iconic uniform range."

Notes to editors

The new look uniform will be progressively rolled-out, starting with London Underground, the Lost Property Office, TfL Visitor Centres and the Docklands Light Railway (DLR) from December 2024. The roll-out will then continue throughout all TfL modes, with River Services, Woolwich Ferry, Compliance Policing Operations & Security, Public Service Transport Planning, Buses, Victoria Coach Station and Dial-a-Ride staff following in early summer 2025 and other modes receiving their uniforms thereafter.
