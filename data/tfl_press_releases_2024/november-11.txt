Improvements include enhanced LED lighting, better information screens and CCTV to improve safety and help people to feel more confident when using public transport
Sustainability improvements have made the bus station an energy-efficient building
Buses will strengthen Kingston's public transport network
The refurbished state-of the-art Cromwell Road bus station in Kingston re-opens on Saturday 16 November following a complete transformation, which includes the addition of a customer toilet, improved safety features such as CCTV and measures to improve the building's efficiency.

Transport for London (TfL) started work to redevelop the bus station last summer and customers will now benefit from improved real-time travel information screens and a fully accessible customer toilet. Safety improvements include enhanced LED lighting and CCTV in and around the station, a wider passenger island with more space for customers and a new PA system. There are also improved welfare facilities for bus drivers and staff, as well as a new retail unit. This brand-new bus station will make bus journeys in Kingston much more convenient, safe and attractive.

The bus station is also now an energy-efficient building with a new canopy in the waiting area to keep passengers warm and dry throughout the seasons. The pavements have been resurfaced and drainage improved with the installation of a sustainable urban drainage system - also known as SuDS. SuDS help to prevent the increasing risk of flooding by managing water runoff in a way that mimics natural processes, using extra vegetation and rain gardens. By having plants rather than concrete and absorbent paving, some of the water filters into the ground, slowing down the rate at which water enters the sewage system during periods of heavy rain.

Buses are the most affordable, accessible and available form of public transport in London, and are the main sustainable alternative to cars for journeys that can't easily be walked or cycled. The changes to Cromwell Road bus station are part of TfL's Bus Action Plan to make London's bus network even better, improving the customer experience and safety and enabling more people to use sustainable modes of transport. The station will serve a total of 32 bus routes, including Superloop service SL7, several night buses and a school and university bus

Seb Dance, Deputy Mayor for Transport, said: "When the Mayor was elected for a third term he committed to strengthening public transport options in outer London to help build a better and fairer city for all Londoners. The transformation of Kingston bus station will be a gamechanger, with improved customer waiting areas, a toilet and new safety features to improve the customer experience and help people feel more confident when travelling by public transport."

Lorna Murphy, TfL's Director of Buses, said: "We're determined to make it even easier to use public transport in the capital and our work to transform Cromwell Road bus station has been a key part of our plans to strengthen the network in Kingston. The new bus station has been designed with customers in mind and we hope customers will be able to take advantage of the new and improved station and encourage more people to use local bus services. We thank the local community for their patience during the works and hope they enjoy their new station."

Councillor Nicola Nardelli, Portfolio Holder for Transport and Highways at Royal Borough of Kingston Upon Thames, said: "We are delighted to see the opening of our new state-of-the-art bus station in Kingston. Cromwell Road is a key piece of infrastructure in our transport network and the new bus station will make journeys easier, safer, more comfortable and more attractive for travellers.

"Buses remain the most affordable, accessible, and available form of public transport in Kingston, providing vital mobility for our residents and enhancing our connections across London. We are especially delighted that it delivers on so many of the priorities important to our borough, with leading sustainable design that incorporates safety, accessibility, energy efficiency and flood prevention during heavy rain."
