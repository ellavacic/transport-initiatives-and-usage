 Glynn Barton to leave TfL to become Chief Operations Officer of Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole (BCP) Council
 
 06 March 2024
 
 


 

 
 Transport London (TfL) has today announced that Glynn Barton, who has been interim Chief Operating Officer since October 2022, will be leaving the organisation at the end of May this year to take up the role of Chief Operations Officer of Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole (BCP) Council. Since December 2023, Glynn has also held the role of the Director of Buses for TfL
 
 




 "I would like to pay tribute to Glynn Barton, who has done a great job of running our operations on an interim basis and directing the largest bus network in Europe"
 
 Andy Lord
 London's Transport Commissioner
 


 
Glynn has been responsible for ensuring TfL's directly operated and contracted services and operations are planned and managed effectively, to provide a safe, efficient, reliable and high-quality service to customers.

Over 22 years at TfL Glynn has used his Transport Planning and Management background across a range of important operational roles including the 2012 London Olympics and the implementation of high-quality cycling infrastructure across London. He played a pivotal role in TfL's transport plan to support events to mark the Platinum Jubilee, the passing of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II and the coronation of Their Majesties King Charles III and Queen Camilla.

In his new role at Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council, Glynn will oversee all of the council's in-house place-based services. The role covers a wide range of service areas which include Environment, Planning & Destination, Investment & Development, Commercial Operations, Infrastructure and Customer, and Arts & Property. 

TfL announced in December last year that Claire Mann, current Managing Director of South Western Railway, will join Transport for London as permanent Chief Operating Officer. She will join TfL on Wednesday 3 April. Glynn and Claire will conduct a handover of the Chief Operating Officer role, prior to Glynn's departure at the end of May 2024.

Alongside the changes at Chief Operating Officer level, a full recruitment process will now commence to appoint a new Director of Buses and if necessary Claire will announce any interim arrangements once she has taken up her role.  

Andy Lord, London's Transport Commissioner, said: "I would like to pay tribute to Glynn Barton, who has done a great job of running our operations on an interim basis and directing the largest bus network in Europe. Glynn is an outstanding operational leader with a wealth of experience who has worked to consistently improve TfL over the years. I am hugely grateful for the leadership he has shown. 

"This next move in his successful career is hugely positive and I'm certain that BCP Council will benefit from his experience and his passion for putting customers first."

Glynn Barton said: "Across 22 years at TfL I have always worked to put customers at the heart of what we do. It is difficult to leave a role which is as fulfilling as supporting and improving London, but it is the right time for a new challenge. And in Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole I will be working to serve an area in which I grew up and for which I have a great affection. 

"I would like to thank all of the colleagues with whom I've worked across my time at TfL - colleagues who work so hard every day to make London, and the transport network that supports it, the very best it can be."
