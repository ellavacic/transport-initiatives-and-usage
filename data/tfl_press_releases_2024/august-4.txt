London's transport network is expected to be busier than usual over the bank holiday weekend 
TfL recommends passengers get off at Paddington station and walk to Notting Hill Carnival and that customers plan and check their journeys before travelling to the Carnival 
TfL is teaming up with Mas band Masology to take part in their Return to the Motherland-themed float for this year 
Ahead of the Notting Hill Carnival this weekend, TfL is offering travel advice for people travelling to enjoy the largest street party in Europe. 

The capital has already started to gear up for this year's Carnival, which will return to west London between Sunday 25 and Monday 26 August. Last year's August Bank Holiday ridership figures for buses and the Tube reached the highest levels since the pandemic, as millions of people attended big events in the capital. This year, TfL is expecting an even busier bank holiday so it's important that customers make sure they plan their journeys ahead of time. 

For the easiest and least-crowded journey to Notting Hill Carnival, customers are advised to take London Underground or Elizabeth line services to Paddington station as the Carnival is only a 20-minute walk away. The Bakerloo, Circle and Hammersmith & City lines, as well as the Elizabeth line offer step-free access, while the District line also serves the station. Smaller Tube stations such as Notting Hill Gate and Westbourne Park closer to the parade can get extremely busy.

Customers are encouraged to plan their journeys in advance using the TfL Go app or using Journey Planner on the TfL website. 

TfL is joining up with partners Windrush Generation Legacy Association (WGLA) to appear in Mas band Masology's float at this year's Notting Hill Carnival. The theme for the float is Return to the Motherland, which will celebrate Caribbean culture and heritage. The Masology float will join a bus featuring Carnival-inspired designs from Go Ahead London, which operates buses in the area on behalf of TfL, in the main parade, with TfL staff taking part in the celebrations on both the float and the bus.  

TfL has also teamed up with Anthony Nolan, the stem cell transplant charity which has been saving lives for 50 years, and WGLA charities and will support them through the sale of themed pin badges to staff. TfL will donate all proceeds from Notting Hill Carnival 2024 pin badge sales to Anthony Nolan. 

Emma Strain, TfL's Customer Director, said: "Carnival celebrates London's wonderful diversity, and there is no better way to end a fantastic summer of events across the capital than welcoming back Notting Hill Carnival.

"Smaller Tube stations such as Notting Hill Gate and Westbourne Park closer to the parade can get extremely busy. The easiest way to travel to the Carnival is by public transport and for people to use large well-connected stations such as Paddington and walk to the parade. This year, as with every other, we are working closely with Carnival organisers and the police to make sure we all enjoy another successful event." 

Deborah Klass, CEO The Windrush Generation Legacy Association Charity, said: "WGLA are thrilled to join Transport for London and Mas band Masology Making Carnival for a second year at this vibrant celebration of culture and heritage. As a charity committed to honouring and preserving the legacy of the Windrush Generation, we are especially excited to bring 40 children from the Croydon Supplementary Education Project to Children's Day this year, fully dressed in costumes that reflect our rich cultural history. The theme 'Back to the Motherland, with a Windrush twist' perfectly encapsulates our mission to celebrate and pass on the diverse heritage of the Windrush Generation to future generations."

Tom Joyner, Go-Ahead London's Managing Director, said: "As the capital's biggest, most experienced and innovative zero emission bus operator, we're delighted that one of our iconic red electric buses is once again an integral part of the Carnival float. Carnival reflects the communities we serve, the colleagues we employ and our city's diversity and we're proud to be a part of it.

"London's air is cleaner as a result of an ever-growing number of environmentally friendly buses entering service and we look forward to working with the Mayor, TfL and our supply chain to deliver even more of them over the coming years."
