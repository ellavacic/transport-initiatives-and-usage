On Sunday 8 September, 30 Londoners will have the chance to join two free weaving sessions at Chingford Community Hub to create a Weaver line roundel that will be displayed in one of the London Overground stations along the line
This autumn, for the first time, each of the six London Overground lines will be represented by a new name and colour to make it easier for customers to navigate the network, while also celebrating the city's diverse culture and history
The Weaver line is the new the name for the London Overground line that runs from Liverpool Street to Cheshunt, Enfield Town and Chingford
Transport for London (TfL) is celebrating the new name and colour for the London Overground line that will become the Weaver line this autumn, by inviting Londoners to take part in a free community weaving event in collaboration with Chingford Community Hub and Cockpit to create a Weaver line roundel for one of the stations along the route.

On Sunday 8 September, 30 Londoners will be invited to join two free weaving sessions between 10.00-12.00 and 14.00-16.00 at Chingford Community Hub to help create the London Overground Weaver line roundel. Participants will work together to create a woven textile of the Weaver line roundel that will be displayed in one of the stations along the London Overground Weaver line for millions of people to see.

The weaving sessions will be held at Chingford Community Hub, which is next to Chingford London Overground station and part of what will become the London Overground Weaver line this autumn. Arriva Rail London (ARL) began work in 2021 to transform unused areas of Chingford, Highams Park and other London Overground stations into local community spaces.

The unused Victorian-era spaces at Chingford and Highams Park London Overground stations were renovated and transformed into dynamic community hubs using funds from Arriva Rail London, Waltham Forest Council, community groups and lottery organisations. The new station community hubs now offer spaces that celebrate local heritage and provide great opportunities for residents and local groups to host events and work flexibly.

The London Overground line between Liverpool Street, Cheshunt, Enfield Town and Chingford will be named the Weaver line this autumn to celebrate the rich history of tapestry, art and design from the areas which the line runs through. The Weaver line runs through Liverpool Street, Spitalfields, Bethnal Green and Hackney - areas of London known for their textile trade, shaped over the centuries by diverse migrant communities and individuals. This free community event celebrates and spotlights the organisations that are passing on these traditions and legacies to Londoners today.

Cockpit is a charity and award-winning social enterprise, home to 160 independent creative businesses in London who offer studio space and business advice for people starting craft-related projects and businesses.

London's Deputy Mayor for Communities and Social Justice, Dr Debbie Weekes-Bernard, said: 

'Naming the London Overground lines will make it easier to navigate the network while honouring and celebrating London's unique local history and culture.

'The Weaver line, launching in autumn, runs through areas of London known for their textile trade, shaped over the centuries by diverse migrant communities and individuals.

'I encourage Londoners to take part in these free community sessions, which are a brilliant chance to create a lasting piece of artwork for the London Overground Weaver line.'

Emma Strain, Customer Director at TfL, said: 

'The Weaver line, which will launch this autumn, runs through an area with deep rooted connections to all things textile and this free community event offers Londoners a truly special opportunity to become a part of this legacy. The completed tapestry will symbolise the power of collaboration, unity and the creativity of Londoners.'

Jonathan Burton, CEO, Cockpit said: 

'Cockpit is delighted to be working with TfL on this project celebrating London's rich heritage of textile production.  As a community of professional makers, Cockpit recognises how craft, creativity and skills can bring people together, creating something exceptional to be shared with the public and encouraging us to reflect on those industries that supported so many in the past.'

A programme of activities throughout 2024 celebrate the rich history of the six new names and colours for London Overground lines, including a 'Mind the Gap' podcast series celebrating the communities and stories that inspired the new names of the London Overground lines. The first two episodes of the podcast about the London Overground Mildmay and Lioness lines are available to listen to and download. The 'Mind the Gap' podcast series was produced by 18Sixty and is available on all major podcast platforms.

TfL is running a competition to celebrate the rich history of the six new names and colours for London Overground lines. People are being encouraged to create a poster or poem for each line that will feature on the London Overground network later in the year. Further details on the competition and how to enter before the closing date on the 30 August can be found on the Made by TfL blog.

About Chingford Community Centre

Chingford station opened in 1878, connecting central London to the then Essex village. The original layout of the station included facilities that were typical of this era, such as a station master's house and a buffet room, where Queen Victoria herself ate a sandwich on her visit. As these facilities became redundant with changes to travel, the rooms fell into disuse.

Work by Arriva Rail London began in 2021, totalling just under £30,000. The rooms were then handed over to Love North Chingford Community Interest Company to further renovate these areas in line with the community group's plans. The group has transformed the space into meeting rooms, a co-working area for remote workers and a podcast/Zoom room.
