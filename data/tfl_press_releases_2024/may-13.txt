TfL has also doubled the frequency of weekend services, with a two-vessel service now in operation, and services now depart every fifteen minutes, seven days a week
Woolwich Ferry is a free service that provides an important link from Woolwich to North Woolwich for thousands of passengers every day
The new service will make it quicker and easier for people to travel in east and southeast London
Transport for London (TfL) has introduced a new and enhanced timetable on the Woolwich Ferry, with passengers now benefitting from a two-vessel service in operation every day of the week, in addition to extended operating hours. Ferry services now operate longer hours on weekdays and weekends, with services running every 15 minutes from 05:00 to 21:00.  

TfL has also introduced a two-vessel service at the weekend, doubling its frequency, helping to reduce waiting times and offer better and more reliable connections with the capital's transport network. The extended operating hours are part of TfL's commitment to make it easier and more affordable to travel around the capital. The ferry is located nearby other important transport modes, including the Elizabeth line and the new SL2 Superloop route, which runs an express service between Walthamstow Central and North Woolwich. The ferry also provides an important link for people travelling on foot or by cycle, enabling them to cross the river for free. 

The improved timetable was introduced in response to customer research carried out that has shown a demand for longer operating hours.   

Darren Ellis, Woolwich Ferry General Manager, said: "We are delighted to be able to offer a new and improved timetable for the Woolwich Ferry, with passengers able to benefit from more frequent journeys and longer operating hours. We recognise how important this service is, particularly to local users, and will continue to work hard to enhance the ferry's service and long-term reliability. This is just one of the ways the Mayor and TfL are continuing to improve the capital's river services, which is key to building a better and more efficient London for everyone."
