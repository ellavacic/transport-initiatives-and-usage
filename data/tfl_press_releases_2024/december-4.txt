 16 December 2024
 
 


 

 
 Changes would improve safety at the junction of Great Eastern Street and Curtain Road by adding new cyclist and pedestrian crossings, and restricting two left turns for motorised vehicles
 
 




 "The Mayor and TfL are committed to investing in work to improve safety at some of London's most dangerous and intimidating junctions, and these proposals will make it safer and easier for Londoners to walk and cycle in the area. "
 
 Will Norman
 London's Walking & Cycling Commissioner
 


 
TfL is inviting Londoners to have their say on the plans, with consultation open until 10 February 2025
TfL is also asking people to give their initial thoughts on improving road safety at the junction of Shoreditch High Street and Great Eastern Street
Reducing road danger for people cycling and walking is vital to achieve TfL and the Mayor's Vision Zero goal of eliminating death and serious injury from the transport network  
Transport for London (TfL) is inviting Londoners to have their say on new plans to make it easier and safer for people to walk and cycle in and around Shoreditch. In collaboration with Hackney Council, the plans would see the creation of new, high-quality crossings for both cyclists and pedestrians, alongside more footway space to help people travel sustainably and cut road danger.

TfL's latest data shows that in the three-year period up to 30 June 2024, there were 14 collisions at the junction of Great Eastern Street with Curtain Road. Tragically, this included a fatal collision involving a pedestrian in 2022. In addition, there were also six serious collisions at the junction, four involving a cyclist and two involving a pedestrian.

The proposed changes in the area include:  

New toucan crossing on Curtain Road to the north of New Inn Yard making it safer for people walking and cycling
New pedestrian crossings at the junctions of Curtain Road with Scrutton Street and Holywell Lane, making it easier for people to cross the street
A new signalised pedestrian crossing on Holywell Lane at the junction with Great Eastern Street, on the western side
Widened footways in the area to increase space for people walking, as well as wider pedestrian crossings on Great Eastern Street
Motorised vehicles would no longer be able to turn left from Curtain Road into Great Eastern Street, or left from Great Eastern Street into Curtain Road, reducing the collision risk for cyclists
Advanced stop lines up to 7.5m deep to allow people cycling to get ahead of vehicles at the traffic lights  
TfL is also inviting residents to give initial thoughts on improving road safety at the junction of Shoreditch High Street and Great Eastern Street. A significant number of people have been injured at the junction and TfL is designing proposals to improve safety in the area. TfL will use any feedback received to help develop a more specific set of proposals for improvements to the junction. A further consultation will be held in 2025 with more details on proposed improvements for the junction.

Will Norman, London's Walking & Cycling Commissioner, said:

'These junctions are among the most dangerous junctions in London, with 14 collisions taking place in a three-year period to June 2024 - one that killed a pedestrian.

'The Mayor and TfL are committed to investing in work to improve safety at some of London's most dangerous and intimidating junctions, and these proposals will make it safer and easier for Londoners to walk and cycle in the area.  

'We want to hear what Londoners think of these proposals, so please do have your say before February 10th.'

Penny Rees, TfL's Head of Healthy Streets Investment, said: 

'These proposed improvements in the busy, vibrant Shoreditch area would enable more people to safely walk and cycle in Hackney. It is for this reason we strongly encourage Londoners to give their valuable feedback to shape the future of Shoreditch before the consultation closes on Monday 10 February.' 

Councillor Sarah Young, Cabinet member for Climate Change, Environment and Transport at Hackney Council, said:

'More people cycle in Hackney than any other part of London, so we're pleased to be supporting TfL to make Shoreditch an easier place to cycle, as well as wheel and walk. As one of the busiest parts of the borough throughout the day and evening, these proposals are a big boost to our own ambitions to make Hackney's streets greener and healthier.'

More details about the proposals are on TfL's webpage, with interactive maps and options to give your thoughts on the project: https://haveyoursay.tfl.gov.uk/shoreditch

There is also Easy Read and Audio versions of the proposals and survey as well as a British Sign Language video version and translated versions of the website.

The consultation period is open until Monday, 10 February 2025.

TfL's updated Cycling Action Plan 2, published last year, highlights the fundamental role cycling plays in making a greener, more progressive, modern city. The plan outlines why it is essential to broaden the appeal of cycling to a more diverse range of Londoners to ensure cycling levels continue to increase at pace and that all Londoners benefit from the health and economic benefits of cycling. TfL's research shows that people from under-represented groups are open to taking up cycling, but experience different barriers, and the plan outlines ambitious evidence-led measures to support these groups by addressing these barriers.
