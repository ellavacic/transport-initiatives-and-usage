 Most services running normally over festive period, but check before travel
 
 09 December 2024
 
 


 

 
 Over the Festive and New Year period, from Monday 23 December 2024 until Thursday 2 January 2025, most TfL public transport will be open 
 
 




 "This festive period, we are once again excited to help Londoners and visitors experience all the entertainment, culture, bars, and restaurants and shops that the capital has to offer. TfL's services are the best way to easily and safely get around the city."
 
 Claire Mann
 Transport for London's Chief Operating Officer
 


 
There will be some planned works and closures that will affect the London Overground, the Elizabeth line and DLR. Full details are available at tfl.gov.uk/christmas-travel 
There will be no service on most public transport on Christmas Day and reduced or no services on some parts of the network on Boxing Day with special services on New Year's Eve 
Additional Network Rail engineering work will mean closures at Paddington and Liverpool Street mainline stations 
Transport for London (TfL) will keep the majority of its services running throughout the festive period, but is advising customers to plan journeys ahead to help ensure they are able to make the most of what's on offer in the capital this December. Resources like TfL's Journey Planner or the TfL Go app will help customers avoid closures caused by planned essential works across the transport network and navigate any last-minute service changes.  

There will be no service on the majority of public transport on Christmas Day and no services on some parts of the network on Boxing Day, including the Elizabeth line.    

Apart from planned closures, services will run all night on New Year's Eve. The Mayor's annual fireworks display is taking place again this year, with customers advised not to travel to the area in and around the Victoria Embankment unless they have a ticket.   

Victoria Coach Station, Santander Cycles, rental e-scooters and Dial-a-Ride, along with taxi and private hire services, will be available throughout the festive period including on Christmas Day. Walking and cycling routes will be largely uninterrupted, aside from New Year's Eve when roads in certain areas of central London will be closed, some Santander Cycle docking stations will be out of service, and some bridges will be closed to pedestrians to facilitate the Mayor's fireworks display. The IFS Cloud Cable Car is open throughout the festive period with the exception of Christmas Day.    

The central London Congestion Charge will not operate from Wednesday 25 December to Wednesday 1 January, with operations resuming from Thursday 2 January 2025.  The Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ) will operate as usual across the festive period, with the exception of Christmas Day, while the Low Emission Zone (LEZ), which covers most of Greater London, will continue to operate as usual including Monday 25 December.    

Services during the festive period are typically quieter, so TfL and Network Rail take this opportunity to make improvements to rail networks when it is expected to least inconvenience customers. These works include improvements to track, signals and stations as well as bigger schemes including HS2.    

Claire Mann, Transport for London's Chief Operating Officer, said: "This festive period, we are once again excited to help Londoners and visitors experience all the entertainment, culture, bars, and restaurants and shops that the capital has to offer. TfL's services are the best way to easily and safely get around the city.     

"The majority of the transport network will continue to operate over the festive period, ensuring that all customers can travel across London in affordable and green ways. We ask that customers check before they travel as planned works are taking place."      

There are also planned engineering works on National Rail services, including closures at Liverpool Street mainline station from 27 December to 1 January 2025 and Paddington mainline station from 27 December to 29 December. There are planned closures from King's Cross St. Pancras International mainline station to Luton on Thameslink and East Midlands Railway services from the 21 December to 29 December. Customers planning to use National Rail services are also advised to check before they travel at www.nationalrail.co.uk/travel-information/christmas/.
