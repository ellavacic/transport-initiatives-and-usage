Introduction of Street View at 18 busy stations particularly aims to support customers who are less confident travelling or have accessibility needs by enabling familiarisation with the station before they travel

Feedback from TfL's Disability Advisory Group indicated that being able to see within stations before visiting them would benefit people with access needs or those unfamiliar with travelling in London
Transport for London (TfL), Network Rail and Google have launched Google Street View within stations across central London, enabling even easier journey-planning.

From today (5 December), customers can now access Google Street View within 18 stations across the Tube, Elizabeth line and Network Rail stations - including Oxford Circus, London Bridge and Tottenham Court Road, with a further 18 stations live before the end of the year.

The project, which started a year ago, has seen Google capture 360-degree images inside a number of London Underground and Elizabeth line stations across central London, as well as at Network Rail stations where they interconnect with TfL services. Google's blurring technology was then automatically applied to blur identifiable faces to protect customers' and staff's privacy.

Providing a virtual representation of some of London's busiest stations will help customers get a better sense of the layout of stations when planning journeys or interchanging between train lines at stations. It will also help customers more easily identify key facilities such as lifts, toilets, benches and help points.

Using Google Street View, customers will be able to see the routes through these stations before they travel, meaning they can use it to plan journeys within stations as they would for walking and cycling across London. Early feedback from accessibility stakeholders including TfL's Independent Disability Advisory Group and the Inclusive Transport Forum has helped inform the project, and indicated that being able to see within stations before visiting them will be beneficial to customers with accessibility needs or people who are unfamiliar with travelling in the capital. The project also supports the delivery of Equity in Motion, TfL's customer inclusion strategy, as part of the Mayor's Transport Strategy.

The Deputy Mayor for Transport, Seb Dance, said: "I'm pleased that Google Street View has arrived at some of London's busiest stations. Now, customers can plan their routes on the London Underground in the same way they would when walking and cycling, helping us to build a better, fairer London for all."

Christina Calderato, Director of Strategy at TfL, said: "The London Underground has always been a place of innovation and we're proud to work with Google and Network Rail to continue this strong tradition of bringing innovative technology to customers. By working with Google to bring Street View to our stations, our customers will now be able to more easily plan their journey through our stations with confidence. This project also supports our wider Equity in Motion ambition to improving signage and wayfinding, helping people to better navigate some of the capital's busiest stations and help us to build a better, more equitable London."

Debbie Weinstein, Vice President and Managing Director for Google UK and Ireland, said: "At Google, we're passionate about creating products that are truly useful and accessible for everyone, and this project represents a significant step forward in that journey. By combining Google's Street View technology with TfL and Network Rail's expertise, we're breaking new ground in transport accessibility and wayfinding. I'm personally excited to see how this recent collaboration empowers people to explore and experience London's transport network in a whole new way."

Malcolm Pitt, Network Rail's Head of Customer Experience and Accessibility, said: "Travelling on the rail network should be for everyone; we want to empower all passengers, including those with disabilities, to travel with greater autonomy. Planning and ensuring the best journey can be overwhelming, especially when busy stations and interchanges are involved. Partnering with Google and Transport for London to bring Street View to our London stations will provide clear and accessible information that will give passengers the confidence to travel and make their journeys as simple and seamless as possible."

Sarah Pugh, CEO of Whizz Kidz said: "Whizz Kidz has been thrilled to be part of the work with TfL and Google on Street View. This will support wheelchair users to travel through stations, planning routes and travel with confidence and independence. We continue to support new innovations from TfL and other partners to ensure access to public transport is equitable for all." 

Across London, TfL is also working to improve access to the internet while on the move. All stations have free WiFi for customers and work is also currently underway to provide 4G and 5G connectivity within stations and tunnels across the Tube and Elizabeth line. Coverage is now available at all Elizabeth line stations and new sections of the London Underground, meaning that customers can stay in contact with friends and family while on the move, as well as use online tools such as Google Street View while travelling to ensure they take the best, most convenient route.

Notes to Editor

Google Street View is a wholly owned Google product. Google's blurring technology is designed to automatically blur identifiable faces before publishing. Find out more by visiting google.com/streetview
The images of inside TfL and NR stations were collected by a small team of Google operators, using a 360-degree backpack cameras
Google is the controller of the images, which includes responsibility for their collection when filming and the removal of faces before footage is made public.
TfL conducted a data protection impact assessment and signed an agreement before deciding to permit Google to collect imagery for this Project in stations on the London network. For more information and the data protection impact assessment: https://tfl.gov.uk/corporate/privacy-and-cookies/ and the agreement https://tfl.gov.uk/corporate/publications-and-reports/contracts
