Transport for London (TfL) has released the newest episode of the 'Mind the Gap' podcast to showcase the story behind the new London Overground Lioness line. On the anniversary of the historic Euro 2022 final win, presenter Tim Dunn speaks with two of the stars from the team, Chloe Kelly and Leah Williamson, about the legacy of that day and the importance of the Lioness line.  

This is part two of a six-episode podcast series on the London Overground names, celebrating communities and stories that inspired the new names of the London Overground lines, as part of a series of activities this year to promote this historic change to the transport network. It follows episode one, which was about the Mildmay line (released on 16 July). The series so far has gained more than 10,000 listens and downloads. In the Lioness line episode, Tim travels to St George's Park National Football Centre, the base for all coaching and development work undertaken by the Football Association, to speak with Chloe Kelly and Leah Williamson. The two England stars talk about what the naming of the Lioness line means to them, the impact it will have on young girls getting into football, and the future of the women's game. 

Later in the episode, Tim travels to Wembley Stadium for a discussion with recent FA Grassroots Match Official of the Year, and TfL staff member, Surekha Griffiths. Surekha, who works as an Operational Strategy Officer at TfL, has a special connection to the Lioness line. She recently travelled to Wembley Stadium to have lunch with then England Men's First Team Manager, Gareth Southgate after winning the FA Grassroots Match Official of the Year award for 2023. Surekha speaks to Tim about her journey into refereeing, the support from her family, and how she hopes more women are inspired to get into football.  

The Lioness line runs from Watford Junction to Euston, via Wembley Central, the home of England's national stadium Wembley, where a winning goal from Chloe Kelly in Euro 2022 saw the Lionesses biggest triumph to date. This was the first major trophy won by any senior English national football team since England men's team won the World Cup at the old Wembley in 1966. 

Seb Dance, The Deputy Mayor for Transport, said: "The Lionesses' victory in the Euros in 2022 showed the nation that we could dare to dream. Not only did Sarina Wiegman's team take home the first trophy for England since 1966, they also inspired the next generation of female footballers, sparking a step change in attitudes towards women's football all around the country.

"The Lioness line will commemorate their victory and its impact in a lasting way, while making it easier to navigate the Overground. I hope listeners enjoy this podcast featuring Chloe Kelly and Leah Williamson, as well as TfL's very own Surekha Griffiths, which gives us some insight into the journey of women's football and explains why the Watford-Euston line got its name."

Claire Mann, Chief Operating Officer at TfL, said: "We are proud to be introducing the Lioness line onto the London Overground network later this year to celebrate the achievements of the England women's national football team and to encourage girls of all age groups to become involved in sport. We are also extremely proud of our own staff member, Surekha, for her success in grassroots refereeing and we hope that her story will help inspire more young girls into participating in the sports they enjoy most." 

Speaking on the Mind the Gap podcast, Lioness Chloe Kelly, said: "The Lioness line shows that we are here to stay, we're not going anywhere. It's incredible to see how far the women's game has come, and now young girls are going to be jumping on that train going to watch games at Wembley Stadium. It really is a proud moment for us and hopefully we'll get to jump on the Lioness line and go watch a few games ourselves."

Tim Dunn, Railway Historian and Broadcaster, said: "Many people, me included, blocked football from our consciousness for decades. So we didn't see the rise of women's football: nor perhaps did we know its long history before. I hope this podcast inspires others to take another look - at a sport that they thought they understood."

Surekha Griffiths, FA Grassroots Match Official of the Year, said: "It was great to speak to Tim about my journey into grassroots football and to be celebrate the launch of the Lioness line, which I believe will help inspire more women and girls to continue to break down barriers in sport for generations to come."

A programme of activities throughout 2024 will celebrate the rich history of the six new London Overground lines, including a competition to create a poster or poem for each line that will feature on the London Overground network later in the year. Further details on the competition and how to enter before the closing date on the 30 August can be found on the Made by TfL blog. 

This autumn, TfL will partner with the Regent's Park Girls League to create a special Lioness line football tournament for under 11s. The tournament will take place on the 14 September at Regent's Park to celebrate the launch of the London Overground Lioness line.

Further episodes of the Mind the Gap London Overground series will delve into the stories of the Liberty, Suffragette, Weaver and Windrush lines later this summer. 

The 'Mind the Gap' podcast series was produced by 18Sixty and is released today on all major podcast platforms.
