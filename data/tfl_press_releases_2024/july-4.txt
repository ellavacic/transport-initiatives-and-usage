TfL commissioned repair works on the historic clock in 2023 to refurbish its dial, repair clock mechanism and replace missing features
Heritage of London Trust supported the repair works with a £7,000 grant and the work was undertaken by Cumbria Clock Company
The historic clock has been reinstalled at Southgate's Station Parade, following a restoration project carried out by Transport for London (TfL), Heritage of London Trust and the Cumbria Clock Company.

The art-deco style clock was installed opposite the Grade II* listed Southgate Tube Station in 1932-1933, as part of Charles Holden's design of Station Parade in Southgate. The renowned architect designed the wall clock as a concrete roundel with brass gilded ring plates and 12 gold button studs marking the hour.

After 90 years in service, the clock was temporarily removed in 2023 to allow for the important restoration works. Commissioned by TfL and undertaken by Cumbria Clock Company, these works included repairs to the clock mechanism, a refurbishment of the dial and a replacement of features that had gone missing over time, such as its gold medallions and sections of the chapter ring.

After being carefully repaired in a workshop in Penrith, Cumbria, the fully restored clock was reinstalled on Station Parade on the night of 4 July 2024. The restoration was supported by the Heritage of London Trust who awarded the project £7,000.

Southgate's Station Parade lies at the heart of Enfield Council's Southgate Circus Conservation Area and offers important transport connections to residents through its Tube and bus station. Southgate Tube station celebrated its 90th anniversary last year (2023) after opening in 1933 as part of the Piccadilly line extension. The station's architecture was influenced by Charles Holden's study tour of Northern Europe Architecture in 1930 and includes several notable architectural features such as bronze escalators and uplighters, as well as one of the few remaining passimeters on the Tube Network.

Gareth Leslie, Customer Experience Manager at TfL, said:

'Working with Heritage of London Trust and Cumbria Clock Company, we have restored an important part of Southgate's local history and architecture.  After several months of work to carefully restore the art deco design, the clock is once again keeping time for the residents of Southgate and all our passengers using our underground station and bus interchange. It's been a fantastic effort by all involved to bring this historic timepiece back to its best and we hope that it remains a local focal point for many years to come.'

Dr Nicola Stacey, Director of Heritage of London Trust, said: 

'We are thrilled to see Southgate's Station Parade Clock restored. As part of our Proud Places programme, local young people from The Pavilion alternative provision school had a chance to visit behind the scenes at Southgate Station, as well as follow the clock restoration project. It's been fantastic to have such enthusiasm in every direction.'

Jane Maggs, Vice Chair of Southgate District Civic Voice: 

'We are delighted that Southgate's Station Parade Clock has been returned to its full glory and continues to dutifully record the time for visitors to the area. The work that's been done has given the arcade a new lease of life. We look forward to celebrating any future heritage renovations at Southgate Station and the surrounding area.'

Notes to editors: 

Charles Holden (1875 - 1960) championed functionalist modernism for his design of London stations, taking inspiration from his 1930s tour of modern architecture and European railway stations. Holden stations include Southgate Station, Piccadilly Circus, Arnos Grove and Wanstead station. In the design of Southgate Tube Station, Holden followed his modernist vision, creating an urban design that interacted with outdoor shelters, bus stops and retail spaces      
Southgate Tube Station lies on the Piccadilly Line between Arnos Grove and Oakwood stations and is located in Travelcard Zone 4. It opened in 1933 as part of the Piccadilly line's northern extension
