 Colindale station on the Edgware branch of the Northern line to temporarily close to allow vital upgrade work to continue, including the removal of the existing canopy and staircases and the installation of new staircases
 
 




 "The major upgrade of Colindale station is set to transform the journeys of many thousands of our customers, making the station more accessible and welcoming, and ensuring it's fit to serve this rapidly growing community for many decades to come"
 
 David Rowe
 TfL's Director of Investment Delivery Planning
 


 
Customers advised to take local bus routes to nearby Northern line stations at Burnt Oak or Hendon Central, to Kingsbury for the Jubilee line or Thameslink services at Mill Hill Broadway
From December 2024, a temporary pedestrian passageway will open to allow customers to access the platforms at Colindale via the existing ticket hall and new staircases, ahead of the station upgrade finishing in autumn 2025
A series of associated planned track closures of the Northern line between Edgware and Golders Green have also been confirmed, with the first closure scheduled from 2-11 April. Detailed travel advice will be made available to customers well ahead of these closures starting 
Transport for London (TfL) is advising customers who use Colindale Tube station that vital work to upgrade the station, including a larger ticket hall and installation of a lift to give the station step-free access for the first time, means that it will have to close from Friday 7 June until December 2024.

Work has already started in the vicinity of the station to prepare for the major upgrade, which is funded by the Government's Levelling Up Fund and significant contributions also being made by Barnet Council, local developers and TfL.

During the temporary closure of the station, customers are advised to take local bus routes to nearby Northern line stations at Burnt Oak or Hendon Central, or to Kingsbury for the Jubilee line. Nearby Thameslink rail services at Mill Hill Broadway or Hendon stations are also accessible using the local bus network. TfL is currently working with bus operators to enhance key local routes and will share detailed travel advice on the TfL website well in advance of the closure starting.

In its current configuration, Colindale Tube station is expected to reach passenger capacity by 2026. As part of the upgrade, the 1960s-built entrance will be replaced with a new, landmark station building which includes a spacious ticket hall and a lift giving step-free access from street to platform for the first time (with existing platform humps giving level access onto trains).

In addition to the temporary closure of Colindale Tube station, there will also be a series of associated planned track closures of the Northern line between Golders Green and Edgware between April and July this year to facilitate the upgrade works. These planned closures are necessary due to the proximity to the track of some of the construction work to upgrade Colindale station - including piling, crane operation and demolition work - meaning it cannot be safely carried out when trains are running. Temporary bus services will run between Golders Green and Edgware stations, and also to Canons Park station for Jubilee line services, during these planned track closures. Weekday and weekend southbound services on the London Underground from Golders Green will not be affected.

Travel advice for customers affected by these closures is available at TfL travel advice - Colindale with more detailed information added as it becomes available.

During the track closures, TfL will take the opportunity to carry out additional track maintenance and engineering works which will help improve overall services along this section of the Northern line, offering a more reliable and comfortable service for customers.

Colindale is one of London's most deprived areas and the redevelopment of the Tube station is central to enabling the building of 11,400 quality new homes for local people. Since 2011, Colindale's population has grown by 70 per cent, making the area around the station the second-fastest growing ward in London after the Stratford Olympic Park in Newham. The upgraded Tube station will increase capacity, improve accessibility and provide a more comfortable and welcoming environment for TfL's customers.

David Rowe, TfL's Director of Investment Delivery Planning, said: "The major upgrade of Colindale station is set to transform the journeys of many thousands of our customers, making the station more accessible and welcoming, and ensuring it's fit to serve this rapidly growing community for many decades to come. I appreciate that this upgrade will cause some disruption for our customers but we are committed to doing everything we can to ensure that, through our detailed travel advice, they can plan ahead and are able to complete their journeys using the public transport network."

Cllr Barry Rawlings, Leader of Barnet Council, said: "Colindale is one of the fastest growing neighbourhoods in London, with a population that has expanded by 70 per cent over the last 10 years. The redevelopment of the Tube station is desperately needed as it reaches capacity by 2026 and, left undone, will stifle our plans to further regenerate the area.

"However, it does mean that TfL will need to close the station while the works take place. Although we appreciate this is the only viable option, we recognise the inconvenience this will cause to those of us who depend on it. Barnet Council will work with TfL to ensure station users will be provided with alternative travel routes and as much advance notice of closures as possible and we look forward to seeing the new, larger, fully accessible station next year."

Delivering step-free access at Colindale station will continue TfL's work to make the capital's transport network more accessible. Since 2016, TfL has worked to reduce additional journey times for those who need accessible routes by 40 per cent, well on the way to reaching the Mayor of London's accessibility stretch target of 50 per cent by 2030 (from 2041).

TfL will launch a widescale communications campaign ahead of the temporary closure of Colindale station and the associated track closures which will include targeted customer emails, posters and PA announcements at stations. TfL's Journey Planner and TfL Go will also be updated with the latest travel information. TfL is encouraging customers to use these real-time travel tools to plan ahead during these essential closures.

Notes to Editor

The confirmed dates for the planned closures of the Northern line from Edgware to Golders Green are below. Northern line trains will continue to run as normal to / from Golders Green station, with a regular service on the rest of the Northern line. TfL will share detailed travel advice with customers well in advance of each of these closures starting
Tuesday 2 - Thursday 11 April 2024 
Saturday 8 - Sunday 9 June 2024 
Saturday 15 - Sunday 16 June 2024 
Saturday 29 - Sunday 30 June 2024 
Saturday 27 - Sunday 28 July 2024 
During the track closures, temporary bus services will run between Golders Green station and Canons Park (to provide access to Jubilee line services) with stops near Brent Cross station, at Hendon Central, Colindale, Burnt Oak, Canons Park and Edgware stations 
Customers looking to travel northbound should alight at Golders Green station for temporary bus services from bus stop GJ on Golders Green Road
Customers travelling southbound should board temporary bus services at Canons Park, Edgware, Burnt Oak, Colindale, Hendon Central or Brent Cross stations and alight at Golders Green station to continue their journey on the London Underground. Catching the bus to Canons Park rather than Golders Green may provide a faster journey for customers near Edgware
Customers may also want to take Thameslink rail services from Mill Hill Broadway or Hendon stations, which serves similar destinations to the Northern line such as King's Cross St Pancras or London Bridge
Northern line customers are reminded that Kentish Town Tube station, on the High Barnet branch of the Northern line, is closed until summer 2024 for vital escalator replacement work
The Government confirmed in December 2023 that £43.1m from the Levelling Up Fund had been allocated to the upgrade of Colindale and Leyton Tube stations, meaning both stations will become step-free for the first time. Funding was allocated to redevelopment of Colindale station immediately, and to Leyton station on the Central line on completion of detailed design work in early 2024
Leyton Tube station will get a new ticket hall built adjacent to the existing one, two new staircases and two lifts making the station fully accessible for the first time and ensuring it has the capacity to support future passenger demand. The construction contract is expected to be awarded in summer 2024
