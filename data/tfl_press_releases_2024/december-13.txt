The newly named London Overground lines and Superloop bus routes are an easy way to get around the capital's neighbourhoods and outer boroughs to explore the full range of festive fun on offer
TfL's 2023 Christmas Tube map highlighted Christmas lights and attractions in central London
As the festive season gets into full swing and popular events in central London sell out, Transport for London (TfL) has teamed up with Visit London to create a map showing festive events outside central London that are all accessible by public transport.

The new Christmas Tube map highlights 19 festive attractions in Zone 2 and beyond and covers boroughs from Croydon to Ealing to Wandsworth and Waltham Forest, with numbers corresponding to the nearest station. From festive light displays to Christmas markets, the map encourages Londoners and visitors to explore more of the capital this winter.

Getting around London this Christmas is easy with the Tube, London Overground, DLR and Elizabeth line as well as tram services and buses. The newly named Overground lines will make it easier to travel between areas outside central London, while the Superloop, with its network of 10 express bus routes, continues to provide fast and efficient links between key outer London town centres and transport hubs. The Mayor's Hopper fare also allows multiple bus journeys within hour for the price of a single fare.

Wandsworth, the Mayor's London Borough of Culture for 2025, has plenty on offer this festive season. You can see Christmas lights being switched on in Southfields on Wednesday 4 December (nearest Tube station Southfields) and the Tooting Christmas Fair also takes place at St Nicholas Church (Tooting Broadway) on Thursday 5 December. Meanwhile Glide (Battersea Power Station), London's only riverside ice rink, is open seven days a week at the iconic power station until 5 January.

The festive cheer can also be experienced in other areas of London:

Justine Simons OBE, Deputy Mayor for Culture and the Creative Industries, said: 

'This December there are a whole host of wonderful events across London and TfL's new Christmas map highlights some of the hidden gems that are happening outside of Zone 1. From Santa's grottos to Christmas markets showcasing the best of London's creatives, there is something for everyone across the capital this festive season. And thanks to the Mayor and TfL, the newly named London Overground lines and Superloop bus routes make it easier than ever to get around, building a better London for everyone.'

Emma Strain, TfL's Customer Director, said:

'When we think of Christmas in London it's easy to picture sparkling streets and light displays in the West End and big events that get booked up months in advance. There's so much festive fun to be found outside Zone 1 too, catering for all ages and interests, so you can celebrate in your local area or even explore a part of London that's new to you. With plentiful transport options including the London Overground, with its newly named lines for easier navigation, and the Superloop express bus network, it's never been easier to explore the hidden gems of London.'

Those looking to plan a festive day or night out in Zone 1 can take inspiration from TfL's 2023 map "A Christmas Too Big to Miss."
