 "We are disappointed that RMT is planning strike action in response to our offer of a five per cent pay increase"

Customers who need to travel advised to consider alternative routes
The Elizabeth line, London Overground, DLR, London Trams and London buses are scheduled to operate as normal but may be subject to last-minute changes and will be much busier than usual
TfL has been engaging constructively with the RMT and other trade unions over a pay increase for London Underground staff and has made a full and final offer of a five per cent increase, which ASLEF members have accepted
Transport for London (TfL) is advising customers that there will be severe disruption across the Tube network, with little or no service expected between the evening of Sunday 7 January and the morning of Friday 12 January, if the planned strike by RMT members goes ahead.

TfL will operate as much of the network as possible, but it is currently expecting the following service throughout the week:

On Sunday 7 January, Tube services will end earlier than normal. Customers are advised to complete Tube journeys by 17:30, although lines serving the Emirates will try to remain open longer.  Football fans are encouraged to make their way straight to the trains after the match as services will start to close from 19:30 on those lines
From Monday 8 to Thursday 11 January, severe disruption is expected, with little to no Tube service expected to run
On Friday 12 January, Tube services will start later than normal, with a good service expected by 12:00
While Londoners will still be able to travel on London Overground, Elizabeth line, DLR and Tram services, they may be subject to last-minute changes, including non-stopping at some stations shared with London Underground, although TfL will do everything possible to keep these open at all times. TfL expects these services will be much busier than usual and customers are advised to check before they travel.

Talks between TfL and RMT are currently ongoing as TfL seeks to try and avoid this planned strike action, which is over pay and conditions. In November, TfL made a full and final offer to increase the base pay for all London Underground workers by five per cent and this was accepted by members of the ASLEF union.

London buses are also expected to operate normally during this planned strike action, but customers should leave more time for their journeys as it is expected that many routes will be extremely busy.

Walking or cycling may be quicker for some journeys and planning tools are available to plan walking journeys. Santander Cycles will be available, with teams ensuring that bikes are distributed at key locations according to demand. Rental e-scooters are also available to hire in some London boroughs.

Glynn Barton, TfL's Chief Operating Officer, said: "We are disappointed that RMT is planning strike action in response to our offer of a five per cent pay increase. We have been clear throughout our productive discussions with our trade unions that this offer is the most we can afford while ensuring that we can operate safely, reliably and sustainably. We encourage the RMT to engage with us to avoid disruption for Londoners. We would like to advise anyone travelling during the strike days to check before they travel."

TfL is supporting customers to choose alternative travel routes where possible through a comprehensive communications campaign, which includes station announcements, posters, emails and social media.

Notes to Editor

If the industrial action goes ahead, TfL will look to amend planned engineering work on the District line, which could result in a closure of the Wimbledon branch of the District line between Wimbledon and Parsons Green on Friday 5 January
