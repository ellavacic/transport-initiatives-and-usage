These changes will make it easier for people to travel affordably and sustainably, provide new local connections, and add over more than 500,000 operated bus kilometres per year to the network 
Buses are a vital part of the transport network for millions of Londoners, with the Hopper fare giving people unlimited journeys for £1.75, made within one hour of touching in 
Transport for London (TfL) is bringing in improvements to the bus network in the Croydon and Sutton area from this Saturday 2 March, as work continues to grow outer London's bus network, making it bigger, simpler and more efficient, while improving access to places where people need to travel.

The bus network across London plays a vital role in enabling people to travel affordably and sustainably, with more than 95 per cent of Londoners now living within 400 metres of a bus stop. By focusing on the local bus network, TfL is continuing to support current and expected demand in the areas, providing connections Londoners need, while ensuring resources are fully invested where customer demand is highest. 

The key changes set to be introduced include: 

Bus route 312 will be extended, providing customers with new direct links between Norwood Junction and Purley 
Bus route 434 will be extended from Whyteleafe South to Caterham Station, providing new connections to the town centre and train station. Bus route 434 will follow a temporary routeing via Godstone Road pending road modifications to allow it to use its final new routeing along Higher Drive in Kenley 
A new route 439 will be introduced linking Waddon Marsh, Sainsburys to Whyteleafe South, to make it easier for people to travel between key destinations in the area including schools, stations, hospitals and town centres 
Another new bus route, the S2, will be introduced in Sutton connecting St Helier Station to Epsom, Clock Tower via Sutton Town Centre 
Bus routes 470, S3, S4 and 166 will be re-routed to complement other changes to the network and to enable buses to serve people more effectively, with route 455 being replaced by the new bus changes 
Last summer, TfL introduced more than 80 electric buses in the area and some of the bus changes will result in additional electric buses serving the area.

These enhancements are part of the Mayor's commitment to improve outer London's bus network and follow a comprehensive review of the local bus network. The changes complement other work that TfL is doing to improve and grow outer London's bus network, which includes the Superloop, a network of express routes in outer London connecting town centres, hospitals, schools and transport hubs. The SL7 between West Croydon and Heathrow Central was renumbered and had its frequency doubled from two buses per hour to four buses per hour when it launched in August, leading to around a 70 per cent increase in passenger usage. The SL5 between Croydon and Bromley was also launched in February this year, providing quicker connections between the neighbouring boroughs.

The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said: 

'When I became Mayor I made a promise to Londoners to improve public transport in outer London, and it's a promise I'm proud to have delivered on. The Superloop has already transformed journeys in outer London, with the full loop to be in service by the end of March. We're also working hard to introduce more localised, but just as significant, improvements all over the network, bringing real benefits to the people who rely on buses to get around London.

'I will continue to improve the bus network in outer London and strengthen alternatives to private car use as I build a better, fairer and greener city for all Londoners.'

Geoff Hobbs, TfL's Director of Public Transport Service Planning, said:

 'We aim to always offer affordable and sustainable public transport options where possible, with more than 95 per cent of Londoners living within 400 metres of a bus stop. We know how vital an efficient bus service is for the people in Croydon and Sutton and we constantly monitor and review our bus network to ensure our bus services reflect current and expected customer demands.

'These improvements will play an important role in attracting even more people to the bus network and we think these changes will enable us to serve our customers even more effectively. As always, we will monitor these changes closely to ensure our buses are operating as they should be and encourage customers to check their journeys using the planning tools on our website or the TfL Go app.'

Route 312 between Norwood Junction Station and South Croydon Bus Garage, which will be extended from South Croydon Bus Garage to Purley, Old Lodge Lane via Brighton Road, providing customers with new direct links between Norwood Junction and Purley. The extension of this route will replace the current route 455 between Purley Cross Tesco and Purley, Old Lodge Lane. Route 312 will continue to operate every 12 minutes during Monday to Saturday daytime, and every 15-20 minutes during the evening, early morning and all day on Sundays
Route 434 between Whyteleafe South and Coulsdon, Ridgemount Avenue will be extended from Whyteleafe South to Caterham Station, running from Coulsdon to Caterham. Pending modifications to the road configuration it will be temporarily re-routed in both directions at Purley Station via Godstone Road to Whyteleafe and Upper Warlingham Station before returning to its current route. The new route 439 will serve Northwood Avenue, Oaks Road, Oaks Way, Kenley station, Valley Road, Beverley Road, Hornchurch Hill and Whyteleafe Hill in place of the current route 434.

In late 2020, we consulted on proposals to change a number of bus routes in the London Boroughs of Croydon and Sutton (https://haveyoursay.tfl.gov.uk/access-our-older-consultations/widgets/34077/documents). Following the consultation, we revised some of the proposals to address some of the feedback received. This was explained in the consultation report, which was published in September 2021
The majority of the changes will come into place on Saturday 2 March. The remaining changes will be expected to be implemented later this year and customers will be notified once dates have been confirmed
A dedicated webpage is also on our website with full details of the changes, including maps and further travel advice - https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/buses/croydon-and-sutton-bus-changes?cid=croydon-sutton-bus-changes
A comprehensive customer communications campaign took place ahead of the changes, including emailing stakeholders, emailing registered regular customers of the routes affected, updating bus stop publicity, a dedicated webpage is now live providing advance warning notices at affected bus stops and key transport interchanges, along with updating maps and posters
The Superloop express network serves many parts of outer London. Superloop route SL7 operates between Heathrow, Sutton and West Croydon, doubled in frequency in August 2023. New Superloop route SL5 started operating between Croydon and Bromley on Saturday 3 February, running every 12 minutes during Monday to Saturday daytimes, and every 15 minutes during the evenings and all day on Sundays. More information on the Superloop can be found here: https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/buses/superloop
TfL's Bus Action Plan aims to increase the number of customers choosing to travel by bus across London by making bus travel more reliable, faster and greener. Journeys are getting better with new comfortable zero emission buses and investing in more bus lanes and the latest traffic light technology to improve reliability. There are also upgrades to real-time information at stops and on buses. Improvements in 2023 included adding an extra one million scheduled bus vehicle kilometres per annum to outer London services. TfL's growing fleet of zero-emission buses now has over 1,300 vehicles - around one in seven buses in the fleet including nearly 100 operating in the Sutton area
TfL has also invested in over 300 new Countdown signs at bus stops
