 Colindale station on the Edgware branch of the Northern line will temporarily close from 7 June to allow vital upgrade work to continue, including the removal of the existing canopy and staircases and the installation of new staircases
 
 




 "Work is progressing well on the much-needed major upgrade of Colindale station and is set to transform the journeys of many thousands of our customers, making the station more accessible and welcoming, and ensuring it's fit to serve this rapidly growing community for many decades to come"
 
 Stuart Harvey
 TfL's Chief Capital Officer
 


 
Customers advised to take local bus services to Burnt Oak or Hendon Central (Northern line) or Mill Hill Broadway (Thameslink) to continue their journeys
An additional bus route (NL6), free of charge, will run every 15 minutes on weekdays at peak times between Colindale and Hendon Central, and relevant journeys on the route 186 bus will be refunded automatically
From December 2024, a temporary pedestrian passageway will open to allow customers to access the platforms at Colindale via the existing ticket hall and new staircases, ahead of the station upgrade finishing in autumn 2025
A series of associated planned track closures of the Northern line between Edgware and Golders Green continues, with the next closure scheduled for the weekend of 8 - 9 June
Transport for London (TfL) is reminding customers who use Colindale Tube station that vital work to upgrade the station, including a larger ticket hall and installation of a lift to give the station step-free access for the first time, means that it will close from Friday 7 June until December 2024. 

Work on the station's major upgrade started earlier this year, with funding from the Government's Levelling Up Fund and significant contributions from Barnet Council, local developers and TfL. 

During the temporary closure of the station, customers are advised to take local bus services to Burnt Oak or Hendon Central (Northern line) or Mill Hill Broadway (Thameslink) to continue their journeys. An additional bus route (NL6), free of charge, will run every 15 minutes on weekdays at peak times between Colindale and Hendon Central. In addition, customers travelling on bus route 186 between Mill Hill Broadway and Hendon Central stations will have their bus fares refunded automatically, when using Contactless or Oyster cards, and after touching in or out at one of these two stations. Normal TfL and Thameslink fares will apply on all other journeys. 

In its current configuration, Colindale Tube station is expected to reach passenger capacity by 2026. As part of the upgrade, the 1960s-built entrance is being replaced with a new, landmark station building, which includes a spacious ticket hall and a lift giving step-free access from street to platform for the first time (with existing platform humps giving level access onto trains). 

In addition to the temporary closure of Colindale Tube station, a series of associated planned track closures of the Northern line between Golders Green and Edgware are continuing this summer to facilitate the upgrade works. These planned closures are necessary due to the proximity to the track of some of the construction work to upgrade Colindale station - including piling, crane operation and demolition work - meaning it cannot be safely carried out when trains are running. For the duration of each of these track closures, bus route NL1 will run between Golders Green station and Canons Park (for Jubilee line services) with stops near Brent Cross station, at Hendon Central, Colindale, Burnt Oak, Canons Park and Edgware stations. Customers will not be charged to use this service. Southbound services on the London Underground from Golders Green will not be affected. 

Travel advice for customers affected by these closures is available at TfL travel advice - Colindale.

During the track closures, TfL is taking the opportunity to carry out engineering works which will help improve overall services along this section of the Northern line, offering a more reliable and comfortable service for customers. 

Colindale is one of London's most deprived areas and the redevelopment of the Tube station is central to enabling the building of 11,400 quality new homes for local people. Since 2011, Colindale's population has grown by 70 per cent, making the area around the station the second-fastest growing ward in London after the Stratford Olympic Park in Newham. The upgraded Tube station will increase capacity, improve accessibility and provide a more comfortable and welcoming environment for TfL's customers. 

Stuart Harvey, TfL's Chief Capital Officer, said: "Work is progressing well on the much-needed major upgrade of Colindale station and is set to transform the journeys of many thousands of our customers, making the station more accessible and welcoming, and ensuring it's fit to serve this rapidly growing community for many decades to come. I apologise for the inevitable disruption that this upgrade will cause for our customers but we are committed to doing everything we can to ensure that, through our detailed travel advice, they can plan ahead and are able to complete their journeys using the public transport network." 

Cllr Barry Rawlings, Leader of Barnet Council, said: "Colindale is one of the fastest growing neighbourhoods in London, with a population that has expanded by 70 per cent over the last 10 years. The redevelopment of the Tube station is desperately needed as it reaches capacity by 2026 and, left undone, will stifle our plans to further regenerate the area. 

"I'm really pleased that TfL is arranging the additional free NL6 bus service, as well as the innovative auto-refunds for those making relevant journeys using the 186 bus route. This will help those who normally use the Tube station for the duration of the works. We look forward to seeing the new, larger, fully accessible station next year." 

Delivering step-free access at Colindale station will continue TfL's work to make the capital's transport network more accessible. Today, more than a third of Underground stations across the city provide step-free access. TfL is working towards the Mayor's ambitious goal of making 50 per cent of Tube stations step-free. 

TfL is running a widescale communications campaign ahead of the temporary closure of Colindale station and the associated track closures which includes targeted customer emails, posters and PA announcements at stations. TfL's Journey Planner and TfL Go are also updated with the latest travel information. TfL is encouraging customers to use these real-time travel tools to plan ahead during these essential closures.

Northern line customers are reminded that Kentish Town Tube station, on the High Barnet branch of the Northern line, is closed until September 2024 for vital escalator replacement work 
The Government confirmed in December 2023 that £43.1m from the Levelling Up Fund had been allocated to the upgrade of Colindale and Leyton Tube stations, meaning both stations will become step-free for the first time 
Leyton Tube station will get a new ticket hall built adjacent to the existing one, two new staircases and two lifts making the station fully accessible for the first time and ensuring it has the capacity to support future passenger demand. Detailed design work is underway with the construction contract expected to be let by summer 2024
