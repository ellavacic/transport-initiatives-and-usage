2024-01-03,Jan, TfL advises Tube customers to only travel if their journey is essential during planned RMT strike,"Planned strike action by RMT members means severe disruption is expected across the Tube network from the evening of Sunday 7 January until the morning of Friday 12 January
 
 




 ""We are disappointed that RMT is planning strike action in response to our offer of a five per cent pay increase""
 
 Glynn Barton
 TfL's Chief Operating Officer
 


 
Customers who need to travel advised to consider alternative routes
The Elizabeth line, London Overground, DLR, London Trams and London buses are scheduled to operate as normal but may be subject to last-minute changes and will be much busier than usual
TfL has been engaging constructively with the RMT and other trade unions over a pay increase for London Underground staff and has made a full and final offer of a five per cent increase, which ASLEF members have accepted
Transport for London (TfL) is advising customers that there will be severe disruption across the Tube network, with little or no service expected between the evening of Sunday 7 January and the morning of Friday 12 January, if the planned strike by RMT members goes ahead.

TfL will operate as much of the network as possible, but it is currently expecting the following service throughout the week:

On Sunday 7 January, Tube services will end earlier than normal. Customers are advised to complete Tube journeys by 17:30, although lines serving the Emirates will try to remain open longer.  Football fans are encouraged to make their way straight to the trains after the match as services will start to close from 19:30 on those lines
From Monday 8 to Thursday 11 January, severe disruption is expected, with little to no Tube service expected to run
On Friday 12 January, Tube services will start later than normal, with a good service expected by 12:00
While Londoners will still be able to travel on London Overground, Elizabeth line, DLR and Tram services, they may be subject to last-minute changes, including non-stopping at some stations shared with London Underground, although TfL will do everything possible to keep these open at all times. TfL expects these services will be much busier than usual and customers are advised to check before they travel.

Talks between TfL and RMT are currently ongoing as TfL seeks to try and avoid this planned strike action, which is over pay and conditions. In November, TfL made a full and final offer to increase the base pay for all London Underground workers by five per cent and this was accepted by members of the ASLEF union.

London buses are also expected to operate normally during this planned strike action, but customers should leave more time for their journeys as it is expected that many routes will be extremely busy.

Walking or cycling may be quicker for some journeys and planning tools are available to plan walking journeys. Santander Cycles will be available, with teams ensuring that bikes are distributed at key locations according to demand. Rental e-scooters are also available to hire in some London boroughs.

Glynn Barton, TfL's Chief Operating Officer, said: ""We are disappointed that RMT is planning strike action in response to our offer of a five per cent pay increase. We have been clear throughout our productive discussions with our trade unions that this offer is the most we can afford while ensuring that we can operate safely, reliably and sustainably. We encourage the RMT to engage with us to avoid disruption for Londoners. We would like to advise anyone travelling during the strike days to check before they travel.""

TfL is supporting customers to choose alternative travel routes where possible through a comprehensive communications campaign, which includes station announcements, posters, emails and social media.

2024-01-05,Jan, TfL advises of five weekends of planned works affecting southbound traffic through Blackwall Tunnel in January and February,"Southbound traffic will need to seek alternative routes across the weekends of 13-15 January, 20-22 January, 27-29 January (a contingency weekend if either of the previous two weekends are not possible),10-12 February and 24-26 February
 
 




 ""The Blackwall Tunnel is used by tens of thousands of vehicles every day and we appreciate that these planned weekend works will have an impact on some drivers""
 
 Carl Eddleston
 Director of Network Management and Resilience at TfL
 


 
Closure to southbound tunnel needed to allow TfL and Riverlinx CJV to carry out drainage and gantry installation works on the northbound Blackwall Tunnel approach to support the new Silvertown Tunnel, with northbound traffic diverted via the normal southbound tunnel
Route 108 will be temporarily split and terminate at Canning Town station and North Greenwich, with customers using the Jubilee line to cross the river to complete their journeys with subsequent refunds available if required
Transport for London (TfL) has today advised drivers that the Blackwall Tunnel will be closed to southbound traffic for five weekends in January and February to help support works to the northbound carriageway on the northbound Blackwall Tunnel approach.

The works, which are required to implement the road configuration for the new Silvertown Tunnel which will open in 2025, will see new drainage as well as new over-height vehicle gantries installed, which are necessary to protect the tunnel. The Silvertown Tunnel will provide a public transport-focused river crossing with zero-emission bus links across the Thames. Once open in 2025, the crossing, which is within the Ultra-Low Emission Zone and will be subject to a user charge, will also reduce congestion and improve the reliability and resilience of the Blackwall Tunnel, which will improve overall air quality in the local area.

The closures will take place across the weekends of 13-15 January, 20-22 January, 27-29 January (a contingency weekend if either of the previous two weekends are not possible),10-12 February and 24-26 February, starting at 00:01 on the Saturday morning and being reopened by 05:00 on the Monday morning at the latest.

Across the weekends, the Blackwall Tunnel will be closed for southbound traffic and drivers will need to take alternative routes. Northbound traffic will not be affected by these closures as traffic will be diverted through the southbound Blackwall Tunnel. However, there will be no access to Tunnel Avenue from the A102 at Pear Island across the weekend due to the works. The northbound on-slip on Blackwall Lane will also be closed and a signed diversion via the Woolwich Flyover roundabout will be in place. Drivers are advised to plan their routes in advance, checking before they travel so they can consider any other potential traffic impacts or restrictions, such as the height and weight limits at Rotherhithe Tunnel and Tower Bridge, both of which are outside the Congestion Charge zone.

During the weekend of the 24-26 February, northbound traffic will also be diverted from the A102 via Millennium Way to the Blackwall tunnel entrance from 22:00 until 08:00 to allow for additional works to install new gantries across all lanes of the A102.  

Drivers of HGVs, as well as vans more than two metres in height or weighing more than two tonnes, are advised to consider routes away from central London across the weekend where possible. To help inform drivers, additional variable messaging signs will be placed on the main roads approaching the Blackwall Tunnel. TfL has also worked with third party app providers, such as Waze, to help ensure drivers who regularly use the Blackwall Tunnel are alerted to the southbound closure and that the closure is shown in any route-planning over the weekend. TfL will also take the opportunity to carry out works within and around the tunnel, to help deliver future maintenance work more efficiently and ensure the tunnel can continue to safely operate. 

Carl Eddleston, Director of Network Management and Resilience at TfL, said: ""The Blackwall Tunnel is used by tens of thousands of vehicles every day and we appreciate that these planned weekend works will have an impact on some drivers. With less than 18 months until the new Silvertown Tunnel opens, we are working with Riverlinx CJV to prepare the northbound carriageway, and have worked hard to try and limit the potential disruption these will cause, such as ensuring a northbound route can be maintained throughout these closures.""

The route 108, the only bus route that operates through the Blackwall Tunnel, will be split in two, operating between both Lewisham and North Greenwich and between Canning Town and Stratford. Customers are advised to then change onto the Jubilee line to cross the river to complete their journeys. TfL will also ensure that customers of the route 108 who then use the Jubilee line as part of their journey over the weekend will avoid being charged for the Tube section of their journey via an automatic refund which will be processed after the weekend. The Mayor's Hopper fare will also mean that customers won't be charged for any additional bus journeys on the other side of the river, providing they begin within an hour of touching in on the first bus. From 00:01 on the Monday mornings of the closure, northbound buses will return to their normal route and southbound buses will be diverted via Tower Bridge until the tunnel is re-opened to southbound traffic.

Work on delivering the new Silvertown Tunnel, which will open in 2025, continues to progress. Both of the 1.1km tunnels have now been fully tunnelled and the 'cut and cover' sections are now in advanced stages of being covered. Throughout 2024 work will continue to install the safety critical systems within the tunnel, as well as complete work on the tunnel portals. Work is also progressing on the new road layout around Tidal Basin Roundabout in Newham, including new walking and cycling paths to make it easier for people accessing the Royal Docks via the Lower Lea Crossing.

2024-01-10,Jan, Pioneering map of London shows the link between deprivation and road casualties,"The Vision Zero Inequalities Dashboard creates a new map of London, showing the stark levels of road traffic injury inequality in the capital
 
 




 ""We're delighted to publish this valuable new tool to enable people to see where and how action most needs to be taken to reduce road danger and inequality in London""
 
 Lilli Matson
 TfL's Chief Safety, Health and Environment Officer
 


 
TfL is publishing borough level data for the first time, allowing users to identify areas and issues that most urgently need to be addressed
In London the more deprived the area, the higher the risk that someone travelling in that area will be seriously injured or killed in a road traffic collision in that area, with the 30 per cent most deprived postcodes having more than double the number of casualties per kilometre compared with the least deprived 30 per cent 
Data shows how deprivation is linked to higher casualty levels, reinforcing the need to target improvements to protect those most vulnerable
Continued action is needed to achieve the Mayor's Vision Zero goal of eliminating death and serious injury from the transport network
Transport for London (TfL) has launched its Vision Zero Inequalities Dashboard tool, creating a new map of London that shows the stark levels of road traffic injury inequality in the capital. The pioneering new tool is the first of its kind in Europe and shows how deprivation is linked to higher road casualty levels, reinforcing the need to target investment and improvements to protect those most vulnerable.

The dashboard enables users to filter the data on the relationship between deprivation levels and road casualties by year, borough, casualty severity and mode of travel, while the mapping function makes it easier to explore areas of higher casualty or casualty location rates. The risk of death and serious injury on London's roads is an urgent public health issue and these tools will allow users to identify areas and issues that most urgently need to be addressed.

Casualty data available runs from 2017 up to the end of 2022 and will be updated annually.  Remaining data covering this time period on age and gender will be added later this year. London collision data is collected by the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) and the City of London Police (CoLP) or reported to the police by members of the public.

TfL will use the data from this dashboard to inform its own investment priorities and provide this data to boroughs to develop their Local Implementation Plans (LIPs). TfL has met and shared the findings of this dashboard with the boroughs with the top five highest casualty rates and top five highest casualty location rates.  TfL will continue to work with boroughs and stakeholders to analyse the cause of inequalities in road injury, help target future road danger reduction programme planning and investment for infrastructure schemes and drive further action to reduce road danger inequalities and make London's streets safer. The Mayor of London is committed to creating a fairer, more equal and integrated city as set out in the Healthy Streets approach within The Mayor's Transport Strategy.  

The dashboard complements the Inequalities in road danger in London (2017-2021) report, published earlier this year, which focused on two areas, the collision location and the demographic characteristics of the people who are injured. This report found that in London the more deprived the area, the higher the risk that someone travelling in that area will be seriously injured or killed in a road traffic collision in that area, with the 30 per cent most deprived postcodes having more than double the number of casualties per kilometre of road network compared with the least deprived 30 per cent. The report found that the same is also true for people living in London's more deprived areas who are travelling in London as a whole. The more deprived the area someone lives in, the higher the risk they will be injured or killed in a road traffic collision wherever they are travelling in London, with people from the 30 per cent most deprived home postcodes having nearly double the risk of people from the least deprived 30 per cent. The dashboard shows that the data for people killed or seriously injured (KSI) in 2022 continues to show these trends.

Lilli Matson, TfL's Chief Safety, Health and Environment Officer, said: ""We're delighted to publish this valuable new tool to enable people to see where and how action most needs to be taken to reduce road danger and inequality in London. The interactive dashboard displays crucial information on the relationship between deprivation levels and road casualties in London. Protecting everyone on the road is a priority for us and we will continue to research how road risk varies for certain groups of Londoners and engage with boroughs, police and other stakeholders to reduce these inequalities. Without safe streets we know that people won't choose the most healthy and sustainable modes of transport and there is still much more to do to eradicate road deaths and serious injuries. We are determined to make London a greener, more sustainable and safer city for everyone.""

Jeremy Leach, Action Vision Zero, said: ""Poorer communities face much greater risk when using the roads.  Now though, communities and campaigners across London have a powerful new tool to help them to tackle road danger and make walking and cycling safer. TfL's new Inequalities Dashboard helps people to pinpoint places where risk is higher and demand action from their local Councillors and their borough.""

Deputy Leader Cllr Rezina Chowdhury, Cabinet Member for Sustainable Lambeth and Clean Air, said: ""Lambeth Council welcomes this move because in our borough people who live in deprived areas are nearly three times more likely to suffer an injury or be killed in a road collision.

""Our road danger reduction strategy, which was published in November, sets out how we will tackle this stark inequality, and the new Vision Zero Inequalities Dashboard will help us, and other London borough's collect the essential data needed to track progress.

""Road danger is a social justice issue, and we are past the point where it's enough to just ask motorists to slow down or pedestrians to look both ways when crossing a road. It is about making sure in the future streets are designed with road safety built-in, making them more equal and less dominated by motor traffic.""

TfL remains committed to its Vision Zero goal to eliminate death and serious injury from London's roads and transport networks by 2041. The dashboard represents one of TfL's commitments in the Vision Zero Action Plan progress report and demonstrates the vital importance of improving access to safe roads and travel options for everyone, but particularly for those in more deprived areas.

TfL is working in partnership with the boroughs, police and other stakeholders to directly tackle road danger and continues to work on a number of major programmes to make London's roads and the vehicles using them safer. TfL and boroughs continue to expand London's strategic cycle network at pace, with 24 per cent of Londoners now living within 400m of the network, up from 5 per cent in 2016. Construction works continue on Cycleway 50, Cycleway 23 and Cycleway 4, with many more routes being developed in partnership with boroughs. TfL has also continued to work on its Safer Junctions programme to make life-saving changes at some of the capital's most dangerous and intimidating junctions. This programme has so far reduced danger at 44 junctions across London, with work on the junction of Lambeth Bridge/Millbank set to start later this year.",0.2959848574467453,Wed,0.9,1.12,0.98,0.94,0.8,0.87,0.83,0.71,0.65,1.01956745623069,1.0344248530646516,1.0276453765490943,1.0177165354330708,1.0220673635307782,1.0020942408376963,1.0110741971207087,0.8068181818181818,0.8188976377952757,0.9519725557461407,0.9587599051419979,0.9464274061990211,0.9457511896668932,0.9940760005779512,1.008219916453308,0.9630733045864367,0.7430863254392666,0.7589704252961732
2024-01-15,Jan, TfL appoints Mercedes-Benz AG and Sopra Steria to new Innovation Collaboration Framework,"These two companies will help to devise innovative solutions to London's toughest challenges
 
 




 ""TfL has ambitious goals to make London a more sustainable city""
 
 Thomas Ableman
 Director of Strategy and Innovation at TfL
 


 
New framework will unlock research and development investment, plus allow TfL access to the extensive knowledge and creativity of the partners and their networks
Solutions could generate mutually beneficial savings and revenue while supporting an innovative, more sustainable city
Transport for London (TfL) has announced that Mercedes-Benz AG and Sopra Steria have been successfully appointed as partners on its new Innovation Collaboration Framework (ICF).

The four-year framework will look to directly address key transport challenges such as achieving sustainability, making public transport safer and helping services become more efficient and reliable.

Mercedes-Benz AG is one of the world's largest manufacturers of luxury passenger cars. The company focuses on the development, production and sales of passenger cars, vans and vehicle-related services. The company also aspires to be the leader in the fields of electric mobility and vehicle software. Within the company, the Mercedes-Benz Data initiative develops, bundles, and distributes innovative data solutions related to Mercedes-Benz vehicles.

Sopra Steria is a purpose-led digital transformation specialist with considerable knowledge and expertise within the transport sector. This includes partnering with TfL to provide a range of innovative services, such as London's world-leading traffic management system.

Through the framework, TfL and the innovation partners will work together to create new concepts and products to help improve how people move around and to make the city a better place to live. By creating this framework, TfL can build long-term mutually beneficial partnerships with these companies and tap into valuable research and development investment, in return for access to TfL's support to create solutions. Unlike conventional procurement, the ICF allows TfL and the selected innovators to work on the most challenging problems as they emerge, taking a solution from concept to scale.

It will also enable these partners to test new products on the TfL network, allowing solutions to be assessed in a real-world environment and create opportunities to scale products in the future. London is a great proving ground for new innovations and showing they can work here will also demonstrate how they could work in other cities.

The framework was developed as the result of listening to innovators to help find a new way of working together that's beneficial to both TfL and the partners, and then in turn to those living and working in London. It will also provide a new, simplified route to bring in investment, new ideas and scale them to benefit TfL and Londoners.

The two partners will also be able to reach out to other innovators including start-ups, academics, and small/medium enterprises to harness their ideas and expertise. By creating this framework, the time it takes to develop solutions should be reduced as partners can help identify appropriate innovators to address problems as they arise.

The ICF does not involve any cost to the taxpayer until the solutions are developed and creates potential from TfL to earn revenue from the innovations that result from it. Once successful products are developed and tested, the framework offers opportunities for TfL and relevant partners to commercialise them in overseas markets, helping to bring in additional revenue that can be invested into the TfL network.

Thomas Ableman, Director of Strategy and Innovation at TfL, said: ""TfL has ambitious goals to make London a more sustainable city. Neither Londoners nor the climate crisis will wait, so we need to move faster than ever before. The Innovation Collaboration Framework is a completely new way for us to work with the innovation marketplace and we're really excited to welcome Mercedes-Benz AG and Sopra Steria as partners on this exciting new journey.""

Deputy Mayor for Transport, Seb Dance, said: ""Making London's transport network safer and more sustainable is a key priority for the Mayor, which is why we welcome this new framework agreement between TfL, Mercedes-Benz AG and Sopra Steria. This exciting new collaboration will address key transport challenges facing the capital.

""We look forward to seeing the innovative solutions that come from this partnership, which will support the Mayor in building a better London for everyone.""

Christina Currle-Hamel, Director Digital Product Management & Digital Extras at Mercedes-Benz AG said: ""The future of transportation safety in London thrives through the combination of technology and planning strategies. At Mercedes-Benz, we're dedicated to support TfL in making this future a sustainable reality by leveraging our company's expertise in digital solutions.""

TfL is working around the clock to minimise disruption on the Tube, bus, rail and road networks during freezing conditions
While TfL are doing everything possible to reduce any disruption, customers and visitors to the capital should check before they travel and allow extra journey time
The Met office has confirmed that the coldest temperatures in 14 years are expected to affect the UK overnight
As the cold snap in London continues, Transport for London (TfL) and London Councils are ready to deal with the severe weather to keep London moving.

TfL and London Councils have developed co-ordinated plans alongside emergency services to keep the transport system and its network of road, rail and river routes open. This includes roads and footways around bus garages, railway stations, hospitals and police, fire and ambulance stations across London.

On the Underground, well-tested plans are in place when winter weather is forecast. These include running a large fleet of de-icing trains, thousands of heated rail points to keep rails as clear as possible and treating platforms to keep them safe for customers.

To keep the TfL rail network moving, points heaters are in operation and teams of staff are available to grit stations along the DLR, with similar activities happening across the London Overground and Elizabeth line. Stations have been gritted and de-icer applied to the rails to ensure minimal disruption.

Many thousands of tons of salt have been made available to TfL and London boroughs to ensure that all road users, including delivery drivers, pedestrians and cyclists, can continue to get around the capital. A fleet of road gritters are being deployed as required across London to keep roads clear, and arrangements are in place to enable boroughs to share salt stores with each other if required.

Glynn Barton, Chief Operating Officer at TfL, said: 

'We have done everything possible to ensure we have well-rehearsed procedures in place to minimise disruption to the network during freezing conditions. Our staff are working around the clock to help keep the rail and strategic road networks up and running, as well as ensuring that footways and cycling routes remain safe. I would urge customers and visitors to the capital to check before they travel during cold and icy weather, using the TfL Go app, our website or TfL social media channels.'

Cllr Kieron Williams, London Councils Executive Member for Climate Change, Transport and Environment, said:

'Boroughs are working flat out to ensure London's roads are safe for all users throughout the cold weather, having ensured there is enough salt available at key locations across the capital to deal with the challenge of frozen roads and pavements.

'Boroughs are responsible for 95 per cent of London's road network and our highways teams continue to monitor high-tech weather forecasts, ready to treat the roads and pavements with salt as soon as conditions demand it.

'We are focusing on gritting key areas around stations and bus stops, schools and hospitals, as well as listening to Londoners about other priorities such as pavements and cycle routes.'   

Londoners and visitors to the city should check before they travel and allow extra journey time where necessary. Passengers can check before travelling by using the TfL Go app. Information is also available via posters, leaflets and ""service information"" boards at Tube stations or through the London Travel Info 24-hour telephone helpline on 0343 222 1234. Wi-Fi is also available at all Tube stations, most London Overground stations, all Elizabeth line stations within central London and Victoria Coach Station, giving customers easier access to the latest travel information for all modes of transport whilst on the move.",0.3719592547164614,Wed,0.89,1.11,0.98,0.94,0.8,0.85,0.83,0.88,0.79,1.0082389289392377,1.0251889168765744,1.0276453765490943,1.0177165354330708,1.0220673635307782,0.9790575916230366,1.0110741971207087,1,0.9952755905511812,0.9413950829045169,0.9501995488460873,0.9464274061990211,0.9457511896668932,0.9940760005779512,0.9850424471095539,0.9630733045864367,0.9210084033613446,0.9224409784368874

 ""Santander Cycles is a vital part of London's transport system and we are constantly looking for ways to improve the scheme, as well as making it as accessible as we can""
 
 David Eddington
 TfL's Head of Cycle Hire
 


 
The 1,400 new e-bikes will increase the fleet of e-bikes from 600 to 2,000 
A £3 day pass will also be introduced in March allowing unlimited journeys under 30 minutes all day and making Santander Cycles one of the most affordable ways to travel in the capital 
6.75 million member hires took place in 2023, the most in a single year since the scheme began 
The changes to the scheme are a part of TfL's work to expand and improve Santander Cycles to make cycling more accessible to everyone 
Transport for London (TfL) and Santander are making significant improvements to the Santander Cycles scheme by introducing a new day pass to make cycling even more accessible and affordable to Londoners. Lack of access to a bike is a key barrier that stops people cycling and Santander Cycles is helping to eliminate this hurdle by boosting sustainable transport options for people across the capital. 

Following feedback from Santander Cycles users, customers indicated a new tariff structure would encourage more people to try the scheme and is a more economical way to use the service. A new day pass will be introduced from Sunday 3 March and will provide excellent value to customers, with a daily rate of £3 for unlimited hires up to 30 minutes within 24 hours. Hires longer than 30 minutes incur an extra £1.65 for each additional 30 minutes. 

Following their hugely successful introduction in 2022, the Santander e-bikes fleet is expanding from the current 600 bikes to 2,000 bikes to make it even easier for Londoners to find an affordable e-bike. More than 750,000 e-bike hires have taken place since their introduction, with double the number of hires per bike per day compared to classic bikes. The additional e-bikes will boost capacity and be distributed across key central London locations. They can be docked at any of the scheme's 800 docking stations. The e-bikes are serviced on street by cargo bikes and electric vans, ensuring that the scheme is as sustainable as possible. Santander Cycles e-bikes will be available for an additional £1 per half hour with the new Day Pass. E-bikes are otherwise available for £3.30 per 30-minute ride for non-members and customers without a Day Pass, or a fare of £1 per 60 minutes for monthly and annual members. 

The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said: ""I'm delighted that we're adding a further 1,400 new e-bikes to the fleet, almost tripling the number available to hire. The e-bikes have proved hugely popular since they were introduced and help break down the barriers that stop some people from cycling. The new day pass rate will also make Santander bikes one of the most affordable ways to travel in the capital. 

""I'm determined to continue building a cleaner, greener and more prosperous London for everyone, and Santander Cycles plays a hugely important role in making active travel around the city as accessible as possible."" 

David Eddington, TfL's Head of Cycle Hire, said: ""Santander Cycles is a vital part of London's transport system and we are constantly looking for ways to improve the scheme, as well as making it as accessible as we can.  Santander Cycle e-bike usage in the capital is now more popular than ever so these additional e-bikes will allow more people to be able to access them. We've also listened to our customers regarding our fare tariff and are introducing a Day Pass to give people making multiple journeys in a day certainty about the overall cost of using the scheme. 

""Santander Cycles has played an important role in encouraging more people to cycle and we look forward to seeing more Londoners making use of both the scheme's e-bikes and mechanical bikes to ensure a greener and healthier future for everyone in London.""   

Dan Sherwood, Chief Marketing Officer at Santander UK said: ""It's fantastic to still see so many people choosing a healthy way to get around and contributing to a more sustainable transport network in London. This year, with the introduction of more e-bikes and new tariffs, I'm thrilled that the Santander Cycles scheme will be even more accessible and affordable for all."" 

TfL saw a record breaking year for member hires in 2023, with 6.75 million hires taking place. This is the highest since the scheme began and highlights the popularity of the e-bikes and the membership options. The membership prices for Santander Cycles will remain at £20 per month or £120 a year, which allows customers unlimited 60-minute rides and an additional fare for e-bikes of £1. The monthly membership can be cancelled at any time. Members will be able to hire the new Day Pass through the mobile app or with their member key. Customers will also be able to hire with the Day Pass at the terminals with a bank card. ",0.26395487345538493,Mon,0.9,1.16,1.01,0.95,0.74,0.84,0.84,0.87,0.79,1.01956745623069,1.0713685978169605,1.0591039084842708,1.0285433070866141,0.9454123112659698,0.9675392670157068,1.0232558139534884,0.9886363636363636,0.9952755905511812,0.9519725557461407,0.9930013303256405,0.9753996737357259,0.95581237253569,0.9195203005346048,0.9734537124376769,0.9746765974127792,0.9105423987776929,0.9224409784368874

 ""Douglas Gordon's undergroundoverheard is a wonderful addition to the Elizabeth line. Translated into different languages, it celebrates our capital's greatest strength - our diversity""
 
 Justine Simons OBE
 Deputy Mayor for Culture and the Creative Industries
 


 
Thought-provoking statements from Gordon's previous works are translated into video format for the first time, with translations into a range of languages, reflecting and celebrating the diversity of surrounding Soho
Following the launch of the Elizabeth line, thousands of customers each day will see the new video artwork as daily entries and exits at Tottenham Court Road regularly exceed 200,000
A thought-provoking new artwork that celebrates the vibrant culture of Soho will launch on 1 February at Tottenham Court Road station. The artwork, by award-winning artist Douglas Gordon, will be presented by Transport for London (TfL) and sponsors Almacantar, the City of London Corporation and Derwent London.

Gordon's undergroundoverheard is one of several artworks commissioned by Crossrail Art Programme for the Elizabeth line, the largest collaborative public art commissioning process in a generation. It will sit alongside works including Chantal Joffe's A Sunday Afternoon in Whitechapel at Whitechapel station and Conrad Shawcross' Manifold (Major Third) 5:4 at Liverpool Street station. Situated in the Dean Street entrance to the Elizabeth line at Tottenham Court Road station, Gordon's new artwork comprises a video on a large screen seen by thousands of customers each day as they descend the escalators to the platforms.

The looped video builds on Gordon's renowned text-based artworks that use short statements to make the viewer or listener speculate, including ""I forgive you,"" ""Nothing will ever be the same"" and ""It's better to know."" Undergroundoverheard puts these texts into video format for the first time, with translations into many of the most spoken languages of the people who make London the dynamic, multicultural city that it is, reflecting the vibrancy of Soho and the international audiences that pass through the area on the Elizabeth line.

The texts appear and disappear on the screen, travelling through the space from top to bottom and side to side, reflecting the transience of people travelling. Conceived from the late 1980s through to the present, the deceptively simple yet emotionally charged statements were previously installed onto architecture such as museum walls or communicated via mail and telephone.

The public commission will be unveiled alongside a new solo exhibition of the artist's work near the station at Gagosian gallery, Grosvenor Hill, London. All I need is a little bit of everything features numerous text works, many also translated for the first time into multiple languages, and the encyclopaedic installation Pretty much every film and video work from about 1992 until now... (1999-).

Undergroundoverheard is lead-funded by property development company Almacantar and the City of London Corporation, and co-funded by property investment and development business Derwent London.

Following the opening of the Elizabeth line, care of the artworks was transferred to TfL's Art on the Underground team.

Justine Simons OBE, Deputy Mayor for Culture and the Creative Industries, said: ""Douglas Gordon's undergroundoverheard is a wonderful addition to the Elizabeth line. Translated into different languages, it celebrates our capital's greatest strength - our diversity. This programme, alongside Art on the Underground, delivers amazing creative works to the travelling public every day, bringing us joy, encouraging us to stop and think and making art accessible to all, helping us build a better London for everyone.""

Eleanor Pinfield, Head of Art on the Underground at TfL, said: ""The launch of undergroundoverheard marks a major moment for Douglas Gordon, with his text works compiled into a dynamic video artwork for the first time. It is an exciting moment for Tottenham Court Road station, with an artwork that celebrates the breadth of global cultures in the area the station serves. These cryptic, open-ended statements will make customers from all backgrounds pause for thought, taking them on a reflective, thoughtful journey in their minds as they travel on the renowned Elizabeth line.""

Chair of Crossrail Arts Foundation, Michael Cassidy said: ""Celebrating the vibrant tapestry of London's cultural mosaic, the City of London Corporation proudly supports Douglas Gordon's video installation, 'undergroundoverheard,' as part of the Crossrail Art Programme. We are honoured to contribute to funding this landmark public art initiative, enriching the urban experience and fostering contemplation among travellers from every corner of the globe.""

Kathrin Hersel, Executive Director at Almacantar said: ""Undergroundoverheard is a brilliant addition to one of London's most dynamic stations, which is now seeing higher visitor numbers than most other West End stations. It epitomises the multitude of cultures that call London home, and brings us together by welcoming everyone to this new vibrant centre of the city. We spend a lot of time rushing around and I hope this artwork encourages us to slow down, take a look around and listen.""

Derwent London said: ""Derwent London is delighted to support Douglas Gordon's artwork Undergroundoverhead which celebrates London's diverse and multicultural heritage, and sits alongside the above ground artwork at Soho Place.""

Infinite Accumulation by Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama will be the final piece of the Crossrail Art Programme, set to be installed later this year outside the Elizabeth line Liverpool Street station eastern ticket hall at Broadgate.   

More than 280 million journeys have been made on the Elizabeth line since it opened in May 2022. Tottenham Court Road station has seen a significant increase in numbers of customers since this date, with daily entries and exits frequently exceeding 200,000 at the end of 2023 with entries and exits peaking at more than 269,000 on Saturday 1 July 2023.[1]

People will be able to enjoy more artwork while travelling in London as six new artworks are set to launch on the Tube network this year as part of the Art on the Underground programme. This includes a series of artworks in the rotunda at Heathrow Terminal 4 Underground station in June by British artist and photographer Joy Gregory, a new sound work by Joe Namy with the Mayor of London's Culture and Community Spaces at Risk programme in July, and a permanent mosaic work at historic St James's Park station by artist duo Hannah Quinlan and Rosie Hastings.

Mobile coverage is now available for customers on the Central, Northern, and Elizabeth line at Tottenham Court Road station.

 ""Improving safety on the capital's roads is key to our Vision Zero goal to eliminate deaths and serious injury on the roads and FORS has played an important role in driving up standards in the freight and fleet industry""
 
 Christina Calderato
 Director of Transport Strategy and Policy at TfL
 


 
FORS is an accreditation scheme recognising freight and fleet safety and environmental standards  
Making vehicles safer is a vital part of the Mayor's Vision Zero commitment to eliminate death and serious injury on the transport network     
TfL has met the target laid out in the Vision Zero Action Plan for all vehicles in the internal supply chain to be accredited with a minimum of FORS Silver and FORS Gold by April 2024 
Transport for London (TfL) is introducing new requirements for fleet service contracts to continue improving vehicle safety on London's roads. From April 2024, all Greater London Authority Group contracts, worth over £1 million and involving vehicles, will need to be FORS Gold accredited or a TfL equivalent approved scheme (Mission Zero and DVSA Earned Recognition). Encouraging fleet operators to take part in FORS is an important part of the Mayor's Vision Zero goal to eliminate death and serious injury on the transport network.  

Making roads safer is a priority for TfL and the freight industry. FORS currently have over 101,000 vehicles accredited across 4,700 companies both within the UK and abroad. The introduction of additional safety equipment and additional driver training through FORS has led to a 31 per cent reduction in serious injuries as a result of collisions involving commercial vehicles based on performance data submitted for Silver audits between 2021 and 2022. However, freight vehicles remain disproportionately represented in fatal collisions in the capital, and more action is needed to achieve the Vision Zero goal. Moving to the higher standard of FORS Gold (or equivalent) will ensure accredited operators meet the enhanced standards which are above the legal requirements for operating commercial vehicles, further reducing the risk to vulnerable road users.  

The new requirements will be enforced from April 2024, and will not affect suppliers with prior contracts. Suppliers holding contracts valued at and under £1 million will be required to be accredited to a minimum of FORS Silver accredited. Their internal supply chains must also be FORS Bronze accredited.  These changes aim to further enhance the safety standards of fleet services operating in the capital, helping them to reduce road danger for all, including vulnerable road users such as people walking and cycling.    

FORS is an accreditation scheme recognising freight and fleet safety and environmental standards. It was created in 2008 by TfL and is now run by Sopra Steria. The voluntary scheme audits fleet operators and awards Bronze, Silver and Gold accreditations. Within the FORS standard, HGVs are required to be fitted with additional safety equipment for the protection of Vulnerable Road Users along with high-quality driver safety training embedded as part of the requirements. FORS assesses and recognises fleet performance in key areas: environmental impact, safety, and operational efficiency. The program provides a framework and sets benchmarks to help operators enhance their performance in these areas.  

Initially run as a scheme for fleets operating in the capital, it was expanded nationwide to ensure that people across the UK could benefit from higher vehicle, safety and environmental standards. FORS provides a continuous system of performance improvement, through the accreditation levels of Bronze, Silver and Gold, providing reductions in incidents and collisions, along with the provision of member benefits, such as savings on insurance premiums, free and funded manager training. TfL and other organisations in London and nationally require FORS standards or equivalent schemes in contracts to improve safety.  

Deputy Mayor for Transport, Seb Dance said: ""The Mayor and I are committed to eliminating death and serious injury on London's roads as part of our Vision Zero strategy.  

""London has been leading the way in improving lorry safety through the Direct Vision standard, which has seen a huge reduction in fatal collisions where sight is a contributing factor. FORS Gold is another example of how we are driving up standards in the freight and fleet industry to build a better, safer city for everyone."" 

Christina Calderato, Director of Transport Strategy and Policy at TfL said: ""Improving safety on the capital's roads is key to our Vision Zero goal to eliminate deaths and serious injury on the roads and FORS has played an important role in driving up standards in the freight and fleet industry.  

""The new requirements introduced to contracts from April 2024 will help TfL to ensure that fleet services across London are adhering to the highest level of safety on the road network, reducing risk to people walking, cycling, riding motorcycles other road users.""    

TfL remains committed to eliminating all death and serious injury from the transport network as part of its Vision Zero goal. TfL is working in partnership with the boroughs, police and other stakeholders to directly tackle road danger and continues to work on a number of major programmes to make London's roads and the vehicles using them safer.  TfL's world-first Direct Vision Standard, which reduces lethal blind spots on lorries, is already helping to save lives and prevent life-changing injuries. From October 2024, TfL will be enhancing DVS requirements with all HGVs over 12 tonnes required to have a three-star rating or fit Progressive Safe System measures to operate in Greater London. ",0.23154597933431728,Fri,0.93,1.12,0.98,0.97,0.77,0.87,0.89,0.92,0.83,1.0535530381050464,1.0344248530646516,1.0276453765490943,1.050196850393701,0.983739837398374,1.0020942408376963,1.0841638981173864,1.0454545454545454,1.0456692913385828,0.9837049742710121,0.9587599051419979,0.9464274061990211,0.9759347382732835,0.956798150556278,1.008219916453308,1.0326930615444925,0.9628724216959512,0.9691468507628057

£41m available to outer London boroughs and £25m to inner London boroughs, as part of TfL's Local Implementation Plan (LIP) funding
London's 33 boroughs are responsible for around 95 per cent of streets across the capital and are vital partners in making them safe, accessible and reliable for all
Funding will support the boroughs to deliver new cycle routes, school streets schemes, new or upgraded pedestrian crossings and bus priority schemes on borough roads
London's boroughs play a key role in the planning and delivery of schemes that transform local areas and meet the aims of the Mayor's Transport Strategy. These include improved public transport, schemes that support the Mayor's Vision Zero goal of eliminating death and serious injury from the transport network and opportunities for safe and active travel in local communities. Enabling more people to walk, cycle and access public transport is vital to a healthier and more sustainable city for all Londoners.

Transport for London (TfL) and London Councils have today published a Borough Three Year Report, which demonstrates how boroughs have used LIP funding over three years (2019/20, 2020/21, 2021/22) to transform local areas, making London's roads safer and more attractive for people using public transport, walking and cycling.

The report outlines the vital new infrastructure delivered through the funding, including:

Making public transport more accessible and reliable with 89 new accessible bus stops, more than 110 schemes to increase bus priority or accessibility and 7km new or improved bus lanes
Making walking and cycling safer through 50km of wider footways, 157km of new or upgraded cycling routes and 74 new pedestrian crossings
Access to cycling has also improved through nearly 110,000 new on- and off-street cycle parking spaces and training provided to 50,000 adults and just under 135,000 children
Around 500 School Streets have also been introduced, with almost 25 per cent of primary schools now having a School Street
New data shows that the proportion of Londoners who have cycled in the past year has increased, including increases among people from Black, Asian other minority ethnic groups, who are currently underrepresented in cycling. In the financial year 2022/23, 24 per cent of Londoners reported having cycled in the past year, up from 21 per cent in 2019/20.

Building on this progress, TfL will allocate £80.4 million in funding for London's boroughs in 2024/25 as they continue their vital work making the capital's roads safer and more attractive for people using public transport, walking and cycling. This is an increase of 16 per cent from 2023/24, when boroughs were allocated £69 million. Outer London boroughs will continue to receive a higher proportion of funding compared to inner London boroughs.

TfL's funding for the next financial year (2024/25), will initially see £41m allocated to outer London boroughs and £25m in funding to inner London boroughs. TfL expects to allocate a total of £80.4m in funding.* The funding will help deliver a range of improvements in outer London to help support more active travel and support last year's expansion of the Ultra Low Emission Zone across London.

The funding will help to deliver a number of new schemes on London's roads, including:

Proposals for more than 150 new and upgraded pedestrian crossings including dedicated pedestrian signals at busy junctions in Barnet, Kensington & Chelsea and Enfield
Introduction of 20mph speed limits on roads in Barnet, Brent, Harrow, Redbridge, Waltham Forest Enfield and Richmond
Junction and corridor improvement schemes that will make London's streets safer, better for active travel and more reliable for buses
Following extensive engagement with the boroughs, bus priority schemes will also be funded, including the delivery of new bus lanes across London. Of the 125 schemes funded, 89 are planned in outer London boroughs. These will help make bus services more reliable and attractive as an alternative to the car and contribute to London's target of building 25km of new bus lanes by March 2025.

Bus priority schemes receiving funding across London include:

The introduction of new bus lanes and significantly improved pedestrian facilities at Anerley Hill and Anerley Road in Bromley, subject to the outcome of the on-going public consultation
The design and development of a new bus gate at Siding Street as part of a multi-modal effort to improve bus journey times and deliver healthy streets in the vicinity of the new UCL Campus and Bobby Moore Academy School in Newham
Funding for 17 boroughs to develop schemes that deliver enhanced bus priority on Superloop routes
The continued delivery of major bus priority and other healthy streets improvements at Longbridge Road in Barking and Dagenham, building upon progress already made on this busy bus corridor in 2023/24
TfL will continue to work with the boroughs to expand London's cycle network at pace, aiming for 70 per cent of Londoners to live within 400m of the network by 2041. Boroughs are central to meeting this goal and this round of funding will enable them to deliver 30km of new routes across London, including Cycleways along Cambridge Park Road in Redbridge, Deptford Church Street in Lewisham, and Cycleways between Hayes and Hillingdon and between New Southgate and Edmonton.

Funding will also deliver more than 2,000 secure residential cycle parking spaces and £2.7 million has been allocated to London boroughs to provide free cycle training sessions to thousands of children and adults.

Penny Rees, TfL's Head of Healthy Streets Investment, said: ""Working closely with London's boroughs is central to achieving a cleaner, greener and healthier London by reducing road danger, improving air quality and encouraging active travel. The Local Implementation Plan programme provides vital, localised investment in bus priority, walking and cycling schemes across the city and this investment will deliver huge benefits. It plays a key role in our commitment to provide a green, healthy and sustainable future for all Londoners and we look forward to working closely with the boroughs to deliver projects that make our city greener, safer and better for everyone.""

The Deputy Mayor for Transport, Seb Dance, said: ""It's fantastic that London boroughs will receive this funding from TfL to continue the vital work they do to keep London's streets clean, safe and accessible. It is only by working together, with boroughs at a local level and with central Government that we can keep building a better, safer, greener city for all Londoners.""

Cllr Kieron Williams, London Councils' Executive Member for Climate Change, Transport and Environment, said: ""This new round of funding is great news for our city. London boroughs are working hard to make our capital's streets better, making it easier to walk and cycle, and making London more accessible for those with disabilities. For example, around 500 school streets were recently introduced across the capital meaning almost a quarter of primary schools now have better and safer access at key times.

 ""There is much more London boroughs want and need to do and councils across the city have hundreds of shovel ready projects to make our streets even safer. For this, we need further support from government. Through local government and TfL funding we can improve our streets even further and properly address the impacts of climate change.""

As part of this year's LIP funding, TfL has allocated an additional £5m for borough-led cycling schemes in 2024/25 as there are significant plans for new cycling infrastructure on local roads, which has increased the total borough allocation to £80m. This will help boroughs to increase accessibility to cycling on local roads and make their networks safer for cyclists. Confirming this funding means that the boroughs now have certainty of funding and can look to progress their plans as efficiently as possible.",0.3620752185388068,Tue,0.93,1.15,1,0.97,0.75,0.88,0.94,0.9,0.8,1.0535530381050464,1.062132661628883,1.0486177311725453,1.050196850393701,0.9581881533101045,1.013612565445026,1.1450719822812845,1.0227272727272727,1.0078740157480317,0.9837049742710121,0.9844409740297299,0.965742251223491,0.9759347382732835,0.9319462505418292,1.0198086511251854,1.0907095256762054,0.9419404125286479,0.934117446518367
2024-01-31,Jan, Places for London launches search for new development partner in east London,"Partnership would deliver up to 1,500 new homes at the Limmo Peninsula in Newham, with the potential for other sites to be added in the future
 
 




 ""We are excited to be searching for a joint venture partner to help us deliver a residential-led scheme at Limmo Peninsula in the heart of east London""
 
 Ben Tate
 Head of Property Development at Places for London
 


 
Scheme will also look to include new public open space, improve connectivity to the river, encourage sustainable travel and provide much-needed affordable housing
Development will be part of Places for London's wider programme to bring forward 20,000 homes and generate vital revenue to support investment in the capital's transport network
Places for London - Transport for London's (TfL) wholly owned commercial property company - has announced that it is searching for a new joint venture development partner to work with in east London.

The new partnership will jointly bring forward a development scheme at the Limmo Peninsula in Newham, utilising Places for London's existing estate, with the potential for other sites to be added in the future.

The Limmo Peninsula site covers around 5 hectares of land, with 600m of river frontage, and sits within the Royal Docks and Beckton Riverside Opportunity Area. Previously used as a work site for the Elizabeth line, the area now has the potential to deliver up to 1,500 new homes, including affordable housing, alongside a range of improvements for the local community as well as new residents.

The site could potentially include commercial space which would support the local economy, large areas of publicly accessible open space, and enhancements to the connectivity of the area, such as a new cycle and pedestrian bridge and a new river walkway.

Sustainability will also feature at the heart of any future designs, with the scheme looking to be effectively car-free, but with some blue badge parking spaces. These potential enhancements would complement the site's existing public transport connections. Future residents would also be encouraged to travel sustainably, given that the north part of the site is less than five minutes' walk away from Canning Town station, with customers able to access both the Jubilee line and DLR, as well as Canning Town bus station.

In addition to the site at Limmo Peninsula, the joint venture partnership will also have the opportunity to potentially develop other sites across east London, helping to deliver thousands of new and much needed homes with close access to public transport.

Ben Tate, Head of Property Development at Places for London, said: ""We are excited to be searching for a joint venture partner to help us deliver a residential-led scheme at Limmo Peninsula in the heart of east London. With the ability to build up to 1,500 new homes, including affordable housing, alongside a range of other improvements, this is a unique opportunity for a partner to help us transform this site into a sustainable development that will benefit the local community.

""This partnership will form part of our wider programme, which seeks to build the homes and commercial spaces the city needs, while also generating vital revenue that can then be reinvested into the transport network.""

The launch of this tender forms part of Places for London's wider plans to help solve some of the capital's biggest challenges and meet its wider needs, including building new affordable housing, delivering new workspaces, and becoming more sustainable. Places for London has an ambition to deliver 50 per cent affordable housing on average across its developments.

Places for London Ltd became financially independent of TfL in April 2022, taking forward TfL's commercial property activity without diverting any funding from transport. Operating profits from recurring revenues are returned to TfL as a dividend to reinvest into the transport network, helping to reduce its reliance on fares revenue.

Organisations interested in the opportunity are directed to the Contract Notice: https://www.find-tender.service.gov.uk/Notice/003170-2024 and advised to register as a supplier on TfL's e-tendering Portal https://service.ariba.com/Supplier.aw.",0.30386385192421655,Wed,0.92,1.14,1,0.96,0.81,0.86,0.87,0.9,0.81,1.0422245108135941,1.052896725440806,1.0486177311725453,1.0393700787401574,1.034843205574913,0.9905759162303664,1.0598006644518272,1.0227272727272727,1.020472440944882,0.9731275014293883,0.9758806177338192,0.965742251223491,0.9658735554044867,1.0065019505851756,0.9966311817814311,1.0094864758918072,0.9419404125286479,0.9457939145998466

Since Sadiq became Mayor the proportion of step-free access Tube stations has increased from a quarter to a third, this new plan will increase this to half
Plan builds on TfL's existing work and responds to the Mayor's key priority to address inequalities and overcome the barriers that some customers face when travelling in London
TfL is listening to Londoners from marginalised groups to guide actions to improve customer experience, safety, connectivity, affordability and health
The Deputy Mayor for Transport, Seb Dance visits Tottenham Hale station to launch the plan and see first-hand new mini ramps being used to help customers use trains, where there is a small gap between the train and the platform
Transport for London (TfL) has published an ambitious new customer plan to help create a fairer, more accessible and inclusive transport network for everyone. The new plan, Equity in Motion, commits to more than 80 new and ambitious actions to further build on TfL and the Mayor's ongoing efforts to create a fairer and safer London.

The wide-ranging commitments in the plan cover key areas for improvements around accessible travel, keeping customers safe, understanding customers, affordable travel, inclusive information and connecting Londoners.

The plan commits to introducing an innovative bridging device across the London Underground network by the summer for stations, which are designated step-free from street to train but where a small gap persists between train and platform. More than 45 mini ramps are now being introduced across the network and this follows a TfL trial in 2022 on the Jubilee line. The device was designed to provide additional support and reassurance for customers, with TfL research showing that 63 per cent of respondents would be more likely to travel with this device.

New research will also be carried out to understand the needs of a range of different communities across London and TfL will create a new inclusive Design Centre of Excellence. TfL will also be reviewing its approach to translating communications into different languages, including British Sign Language, increasing the number of step-free access stations, expanding the Project Guardian school sessions on sexual harassment and making it easier for people to report crime, antisocial behaviour, discrimination, and safety concerns. These improvements, some of which are underway already, will help make everyone feel welcome on the transport network, enable more people to travel confidently and with ease.

With almost a third of the capital's population living in poverty and more than 15 per cent reported as being disabled, millions of Londoners face barriers to using public transport. Factors including poor street environments, toxic air and road danger negatively impact all Londoners, but disproportionately affect marginalised groups.

These bold new commitments are part of a number of actions the Mayor is taking to achieve the ambition of his Transport Strategy and move London forward safely, inclusively and sustainably. The plan focuses on creating an equitable customer experience, protecting, and enhancing connectivity, keeping travel affordable and reducing health inequalities and includes a number of short-term and long-term commitments.

Several actions will be delivered this year, while others will be implemented by 2030, subject to Government funding. The plan's commitments include:

Accessible Travel

Increasing the proportion of step-free Tube stations. Since Sadiq became Mayor the proportion of step-free access Tube stations has increased from a quarter to a third, this new plan will increase this to half
Introducing mini ramps to cover the gap between the train and platform at all London Underground platforms that are step-free to train
Launching an innovation challenge aimed at improving travel for disabled people

The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said: 

'London is for everyone and I am committed to making our transport network as fair and accessible as possible so that every Londoner can make the most of our fantastic city.

'TfL is committed to removing the barriers that people face when using the transport network and enabling more people to travel spontaneously, seamlessly and easily.  Some of these vital improvements are already underway and there are many more to come, helping us to continue building a better, fairer London for everyone.'

Alex Williams, Chief Customer and Strategy Officer at TfL, said: 

'Our vision is a London where everyone can move around the city safely, inclusively and sustainably, and access to public transport is a fundamental component in making this happen. While we have taken steps to make our network more accessible, we know that much more needs to be done. Equity in Motion draws on the experiences and viewpoints of a range of Londoners, prioritising the areas they want to see improved to create tangible actions that drive forward change and help make London a truly fair city.'

TfL has already begun work on many of the plan's longer-term actions, including improving HGV safety standards, launching new cycle lanes and reducing road danger across London. Other longer-term actions include making further improvements to toilets across the network.

Agnes Fletcher, Member of TfL's Independent Disability Advisory Group, said: 

'We were pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to the development of the Equity in Motion plan for London.

'All Londoners will benefit from the change it promises, including more affordable travel and cleaner air. And more people with impairments, with long-term health conditions and who are neurodivergent will be able to use the transport network, and to reach more of London safely and comfortably.

'Disabled people are part of every demographic and every community. The barriers we face just in getting around - to work, to access healthcare, to see family and friends, to access all the wonderful things London has to offer - can be reduced or removed by taking enabling actions like those in Equity in Motion. The result will be a cleaner, greener, more active and enjoyable London - where everyone feels as though they matter.'

Emma Vogelmann, Policy and Public Affairs Manager at Transport for All, said: 

'These new commitments are really encouraging for the 1.2 million Londoners who are disabled, and are a positive approach to addressing some of the most significant barriers we face when getting around the capital. 

'Access barriers for travelling in London include a lack of step-free stations, few priority seats on buses, and missing or inaccessible travel information - all of which can conspire to making our journeys longer or more painful, or even stop us getting beyond the front door. We're pleased to see TfL commit to making changes to tackle these barriers. Coproducing schemes with the disabled community will be vital to ensure the measures in this plan can bring about real change.'

2024-02-05,Feb, TfL completes work on two major new sections of Cycleway in Hackney and Islington,"Construction work to extend Cycleway 50 and Cycleway 23 is now complete, making cycling even more accessible  
 
 




 ""The Mayor and I want to build on the boom in cycling we've seen in recent years, as our rapidly expanding cycle network enables more and more Londoners to switch to cycling for local journeys""
 
 Will Norman
 London's Walking and Cycling Commissioner
 


 
The new section of Cycleway 50 extends the route from Finsbury Park to Holloway Road 
Work on Cycleway 23 has delivered a much safer cycling route through Lea Bridge Roundabout, connecting the existing route to Dalston 
Enabling more people to walk and cycle is vital to a healthier and more sustainable transport network for all Londoners   
Recent TfL data reveals the number of daily cycle journeys increased to 1.26 million in 2023, up by 6.3 per cent since 2022 
Transport for London (TfL) has completed work on the latest phase of Cycleway 50 in Islington and Cycleway 23 in Hackney, as part of TfL's commitment to expand the network, making it even safer and easier for people to travel around London. The extended routes will play a vital role in enabling people living in and travelling through the area to travel affordably and sustainably. Around 60 per cent of households in inner London do not have access to a car and creating enough space for people to walk and cycle safely is vital to a sustainable transport network. TfL data has shown that the number of daily cycle journeys increased to 1.26 million in 2023, up by 6.3 per cent since 2022.

On Cycleway 50 in Islington, the new sections between Finsbury Park and Holloway Road connect people in local neighbourhoods along two new segregated cycle lanes, running westbound along Seven Sisters Road and eastbound along Isledon Road and Tollington Road. The work means that the Nag's Head gyratory is now integrated into the existing cycle network, making it safer and easier for people to navigate this previously intimidating section of the road network by bike. Cycleway 50 now runs between Holloway Road to Finsbury Park, further extending the Cycleway network for thousands of people living in the borough.

On Cycleway 23, Lea Bridge Roundabout has been transformed to make it safer for people walking and cycling. There are now new segregated cycle lanes on the overhauled roundabout to separate people cycling from traffic, while pedestrian crossing and signals at the roundabout have been upgraded to make it easier for people to walk.

Previous analysis carried out by TfL has shown that the Camden to Finsbury Park corridor is within the top five per cent in London with the greatest potential for increasing the number of people cycling, and one of the top ten for travel to and from central London. Between June 2017 and June 2020, 31 people cycling and 53 people walking were injured at the Nag's Head gyratory and the route forms part of the Mayor's Vision Zero commitment to eliminate death and serious injury on the transport network.

The Cycleway 23 route between Lea Bridge and Dalston was identified in TfL's Strategic Cycling Analysis as a key area for existing and potential cycling. Once complete, Cycleway 23 will be a major new walking and cycling corridor connecting neighbourhoods in Hackney and Waltham Forest to London's growing network of high-quality cycleways.

Will Norman, London's Walking and Cycling Commissioner, said:

'The Mayor and I want to build on the boom in cycling we've seen in recent years, as our rapidly expanding cycle network enables more and more Londoners to switch to cycling for local journeys. The extension of these two cycleways will make cycling journeys easier and safer around Hackney and Islington and help us continue building a better, greener, safer London for everyone.'

Penny Rees, TfL's Head of Healthy Streets Investment, said:

'This is an exciting next step in extending Cycleways 23 and 50, which will help more people across London to access the growing network of high-quality Cycleways. Our continued work in expanding these routes unlocks access to cycling for many more thousands of Londoners, contributing to a greener and fairer city.  Everyone in London deserves safe and sustainable travel, regardless of where they live and we will continue to work closely with boroughs to connect even more of the capital to our high-quality cycle network.'

Cllr Rowena Champion, Islington Council's Executive Member for Environment, Air Quality, and Transport, said: 

'Here in Islington, we believe that streets aren't just a route from A to B - they're community spaces for people of all ages and backgrounds to enjoy, and play a key role in our efforts to create a greener, healthier, more equal borough. That's why we're so supportive of the creation of Cycleway 50, which will help make it easier for people of all ages and backgrounds to walk, cycle, and wheel. These exciting changes will help to reduce air pollution, support more local people to fit physical activity into their day, and create more welcoming spaces for all to enjoy.'

Cycleway 50 is an experimental scheme. Local residents will be invited to share their views on the scheme in a consultation from May 2024.

TfL and the boroughs continue to expand London's strategic cycle network at pace, with 24 per cent of Londoners now living within 400m of the network, up from 5 per cent in 2016. Construction works continue on Cycleway 4, with many more routes being developed in partnership with boroughs.

TfL will continue to work closely with London boroughs to deliver even more walking and cycling infrastructure in the coming years. At Old Street, protected cycle lanes around the former roundabout are now complete, enabling people to travel through this busy junction safely and confidently. TfL and Southwark Council are also continuing work to complete Cycleway 4, a major high-quality Cycleway which will connect central London, Greenwich and beyond once complete.  ",0.31252908471718643,Mon,0.93,1.16,1.04,0.98,0.76,0.86,0.91,0.82,0.73,1,1.0265486725663717,1.0291036088474972,1.0078644888082275,0.9335260115606937,0.9871708305199189,1.0340909090909092,0.8918746001279589,0.8832740213523131,0.9837049742710121,0.9930013303256405,1.0043719412724306,0.9859959211420802,0.9443722005490536,0.9966311817814311,1.0558996471971775,0.8582123758594347,0.8523821699480099
2024-02-05,Feb, TfL launches consultation on plans to extend DLR to Beckton Riverside and Thamesmead,"Proposals to extend the DLR from Gallions Reach to Thamesmead via Beckton Riverside would create two brand new stations 
 
 




 ""This would be a much-needed public transport improvement for the people of Thamesmead who need to be able to travel easily and cheaply for work, study or leisure""
 
 Abena Oppong-Asare 
 Member of Parliament for Erith and Thamesmead
 


 
Consultation is open from 5 February 2024 to 18 March 2024 
Up to 25,000-30,000 new homes could be unlocked along the route of the DLR extension in the Royal Borough of Greenwich and London Borough of Newham  
The extension would also support the creation of up to 10,000 jobs
Transport for London (TfL) is inviting people to have their say on proposals for an extension of the DLR. The preferred route is a cross-river extension of the DLR from Gallions Reach to Thamesmead via Beckton Riverside, and working with the Royal Borough of Greenwich and the London Borough of Newham  two brand new stations would be created.

The plans would support the delivery of new transport links, homes and regeneration in Thamesmead and Beckton, and the consultation is open from 5 February 2024 to 18 March 2024. Public feedback will be used to help make decisions about the scheme and inform the designs and next steps. The next stage in the process after public consultation will be progressing the scheme towards Outline Business Case.

TfL has been working together with the Royal Borough of Greenwich, the London Borough of Newham and the Greater London Authority (GLA), as well as landowners Peabody, Lendlease, abrdn, St William (Berkeley Homes) and Homes England to support the delivery of new homes, improved town centres and better access to jobs within and from Beckton Riverside and Thamesmead. This will only be possible by improving public transport connections. The partnership is also working closely with Government, demonstrating the importance of the project to the local and wider area.

The proposed DLR extension from Gallions Reach to Thamesmead via Beckton Riverside would connect two Opportunity Areas and four development sites. A new DLR station would be built at Beckton Riverside, with a tunnel built under the River Thames linked to another new DLR station at Thamesmead. It would build on experience from 2009 when the DLR was extended to Woolwich Arsenal, tunnelling beneath the River Thames, with housing growth following in areas including Woolwich, Canning Town, and the Royal Docks.

With significant growth pressures on London and the South East, transport and housing infrastructure must keep pace with demand. Forecasts suggest that London's population will have grown significantly by 2041, and that there will be at least an additional 800,000 jobs in the capital, which will create the need for more housing.

Providing new public transport options like the DLR extension would support low-carbon developments in Thamesmead and Beckton Riverside, unlocking the delivery of up to 25,000-30,000 new homes along the extended route. It will also improve connectivity across the river and provide alternatives to private car use to lower future emissions and resulting pollution levels.

Investment in this scheme would support a UK-wide supply chain, supporting growth and job creation across the country. The DLR extension would also directly support the creation of up to 10,000 jobs, benefitting London and the national economy, and it would provide quicker journeys to other parts of east London like Stratford and the Isle of Dogs, with direct connections to central London via the Jubilee and Elizabeth lines, transforming housing, employment and leisure opportunities for the people who live in the area.

The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan said: ""Although we have started a record-breaking 116,000 plus genuinely affordable homes and completed more homes of all types since any time since the 1930s, the demand for housing in London shows no sign of slowing down.

""I'm excited for TfL to launch this consultation - extending the DLR will unlock huge opportunities for London, support tens of thousands of new homes, deliver new transport connections, and boost the economy, supporting the creation of thousands of jobs. Enabling the infrastructure needed for the capital's growth is key to building a better, more prosperous London for everyone.""

Alex Williams, Chief Customer and Strategy Officer, said: ""Extending the DLR from Gallions Reach to Thamesmead via Beckton Riverside presents a crucial opportunity to boost connectivity by linking two major growth areas with two new accessible stations.

""This important public consultation will ensure we can get feedback from those who may benefit from the extension in future to help shape the scheme as we progress through to the next stages of planning.""

Cllr Anthony Okereke, Leader of the Royal Borough of Greenwich, said: ""The DLR extension is central to the regeneration of Thamesmead and would transform the area, just like the Elizabeth line has done for Woolwich and Abbey Wood.  We remain committed as part of Our Greenwich mission to make it easier, safer and greener for residents to move around the borough and the rest of London. High quality public transport is essential to our local economy; this extension would support thousands of jobs and the delivery of up to 15,000 new homes in Thamesmead. We encourage residents and businesses to participate in the consultation and share their feedback on the proposals"".

Abena Oppong-Asare MP, Member of Parliament for Erith and Thamesmead, said: ""I am very pleased that TfL is launching a consultation on plans to extend the DLR to our community in Thamesmead.

""This would be a much-needed public transport improvement for the people of Thamesmead who need to be able to travel easily and cheaply for work, study or leisure.

""I've long campaigned for these ambitious plans to put Thamesmead on the transport map and I'm pleased to have had the support of local authorities, TfL, local businesses, community groups, and most importantly the people who live here.""

Rokhsana Fiaz OBE, Mayor of Newham, said: "" The new DLR extension has the potential to create a new town centre in the south of the borough, with more affordable homes, improved community infrastructure, as well as opening up the riverfront to everyone. Our tried and tested co-production model is how we ensure residents' voices are listened to and heard in all the important decisions we make to shape the future of the borough. So I urge Newham residents to take the time to feed into these important consultations which will help us and the project partners move on to the next steps to make these plans a reality.""

TfL and its partners submitted a Strategic Outline Case (SOC) to Government in 2023 outlining how an extension of the DLR could have a transformative effect on the area. While a key part of this work will be to identify options for maximising local and regional sources of funding, as well as driving cost and creating efficiencies, the scale of the projects mean that some degree of external support will be required.

Funding for the feasibility work has been provided to date by a partnership of private and public sector bodies with an interest in regenerating the area. The aim is to agree an affordable solution by 2025, in order to enable construction to begin as early as 2028 and opening the DLR extension to customers in the early 2030s.

TfL is also introducing 54 new trains ,with 33 replacing the oldest trains in the current DLR fleet and the remainder used to boost capacity and meet growing demand across the DLR network. These will be introduced from 2024, with the whole fleet in place by 2026.

TfL explored a number of other transport options including increasing the number and frequency of bus services in Thamesmead and Beckton Riverside, without a new rail service. Although this would improve links to local town centres and the rail network, this option alone would not provide the level of connectivity or capacity needed to enable the 25,000 - 30,000 planned new homes in the area.

A brand-new Superloop route, the SL3, will also be introduced between Thamesmead and Bromley by spring this year and is part of a network of express routes in outer London connecting town centres, hospitals, schools and transport hubs and is a key part of the Mayor's commitment to improving the bus network in outer London. There are also wider proposals for upgrading existing DLR stations to cope with additional demand expected over the coming years.

Funding was announced by Government in the 2023 Autumn Statement to support housing development, improved town centres and better access to jobs (subject to approval of a business case), by delivering a bus transit scheme using dedicated infrastructure from Woolwich to Abbey Wood via Thamesmead. The potential new infrastructure would support not just the bus transit route, but many other bus routes in the area. Consultation on this will take place at a later date.",0.30953428428830704,Mon,0.93,1.16,1.04,0.98,0.76,0.86,0.91,0.82,0.73,1,1.0265486725663717,1.0291036088474972,1.0078644888082275,0.9335260115606937,0.9871708305199189,1.0340909090909092,0.8918746001279589,0.8832740213523131,0.9837049742710121,0.9930013303256405,1.0043719412724306,0.9859959211420802,0.9443722005490536,0.9966311817814311,1.0558996471971775,0.8582123758594347,0.8523821699480099
2024-02-06,Feb, Vital renewal work will mean part closure of Piccadilly line this month,"Points at Northfields need to be replaced as part of renewal of the line, including the introduction of transformative new trains from 2025 
 
 




 ""The track at Northfields has to be replaced and doing so will make journeys smoother and more reliable, as well as enable us to deliver as much of the improvements made by the upgrade to the Piccadilly line as possible""
 
 Richard Jones
 Director of Asset Performance Delivery for TfL
 


 
Closure will also allow work to be completed at Heathrow Airport stations
Line will be closed between Hammersmith and Heathrow Airport on morning of Saturday 10 February
Closure will then change to Acton Town to Heathrow Airport from Saturday morning until start of service on Thursday 15 February
Access to Heathrow Airport will be provided via the Elizabeth line, as well as replacement bus services 
A part closure will affect Piccadilly line customers from Saturday 10 February until Wednesday 14 February for important engineering work. Vital upgrade works to points at Northfields will be completed during the closure, improving the line infrastructure alongside the introduction of transformative new trains from 2025. Other important work will also be completed including infrastructure work at Heathrow Airport stations.

The Piccadilly line will be closed between Hammersmith and Heathrow Airport from 00:45 to 05:00 on Saturday 10 February, meaning there will be no Night Tube west of Hammersmith station. The closure will then change from start of normal service on Saturday, with no trains between Acton Town and Heathrow until start of service on Thursday 15 February.

The points at Northfields are on a complicated stretch of track where trains come out of Northfields depot to enter service. The track in this area features some components from the 1930s and must be replaced as the assets are unreliable and maintenance is costly. The closure will take five days because it is not a like-for-like renewal, which means that once the first section is removed, the rest of the track in the area must be removed and replaced. Replacing the track will not only address the ongoing issues but will also mean a better, smoother ride once the new Piccadilly line trains are introduced.

Customers travelling during these times are encouraged to plan ahead, using real time travel tools such as TfL Go and Journey Planner, to check before travelling and to allow more time for their journeys. Customers travelling to Heathrow Airport should use Elizabeth line services. There will be rail replacement buses serving local stations from Acton Town to Heathrow Airport, as well as many local buses.

Richard Jones, Director of Asset Performance Delivery for TfL, said:

'We thank customers in advance for their patience during this vital closure of the Piccadilly line. The track at Northfields has to be replaced and doing so will make journeys smoother and more reliable, as well as enable us to deliver as much of the improvements made by the upgrade to the Piccadilly line as possible.

'The Elizabeth line will help customers reach Heathrow Airport during this closure but we will also be operating rail replacement buses in Hounslow and the surrounding areas. Customers should check before they travel and leave more time for their journeys during this work.'

The new Piccadilly line trains are part of a £2.9bn investment to modernise the Piccadilly line, rolling out 94 brand new trains from 2025 onwards to help the line run more reliably, safely, inclusively and sustainably.

The new trains will feature walk-through carriages, air-conditioning, wider all-double doorways to help customers get on and off more easily, enhanced digital display screens for customer information, on-train CCTV cameras for additional customer security and will, for the first time on a Deep Tube train, provide air conditioning. They will increase capacity by 10 per cent and will also improve energy efficiency and accessibility.

The points are located beneath a bridge, which means they cannot be replaced quickly during engineering hours. This has meant the need for a closure of the line to carry out the work. With the line closed, infrastructure work will also take place around Hounslow and at stations at Heathrow Airport so that TfL can minimise future disruption. ",0.2344349716989019,Tue,0.93,1.15,1.01,0.98,0.83,0.87,0.94,0.86,0.77,1,1.0176991150442478,0.9994179278230502,1.0078644888082275,1.0195086705202312,0.9986495611073598,1.0681818181818181,0.9353806781829814,0.9316725978647687,0.9837049742710121,0.9844409740297299,0.9753996737357259,0.9859959211420802,1.0313538505996243,1.008219916453308,1.0907095256762054,0.9000763941940413,0.8990880422739282
2024-02-07,Feb, Colindale Tube station to close from Friday 7 June as part of its major upgrade,"Colindale station on the Edgware branch of the Northern line to temporarily close to allow vital upgrade work to continue, including the removal of the existing canopy and staircases and the installation of new staircases
 
 




 ""The major upgrade of Colindale station is set to transform the journeys of many thousands of our customers, making the station more accessible and welcoming, and ensuring it's fit to serve this rapidly growing community for many decades to come""

 TfL's Director of Investment Delivery Planning
 


 
Customers advised to take local bus routes to nearby Northern line stations at Burnt Oak or Hendon Central, to Kingsbury for the Jubilee line or Thameslink services at Mill Hill Broadway
From December 2024, a temporary pedestrian passageway will open to allow customers to access the platforms at Colindale via the existing ticket hall and new staircases, ahead of the station upgrade finishing in autumn 2025
A series of associated planned track closures of the Northern line between Edgware and Golders Green have also been confirmed, with the first closure scheduled from 2-11 April. Detailed travel advice will be made available to customers well ahead of these closures starting 
Transport for London (TfL) is advising customers who use Colindale Tube station that vital work to upgrade the station, including a larger ticket hall and installation of a lift to give the station step-free access for the first time, means that it will have to close from Friday 7 June until December 2024.

Work has already started in the vicinity of the station to prepare for the major upgrade, which is funded by the Government's Levelling Up Fund and significant contributions also being made by Barnet Council, local developers and TfL.

During the temporary closure of the station, customers are advised to take local bus routes to nearby Northern line stations at Burnt Oak or Hendon Central, or to Kingsbury for the Jubilee line. Nearby Thameslink rail services at Mill Hill Broadway or Hendon stations are also accessible using the local bus network. TfL is currently working with bus operators to enhance key local routes and will share detailed travel advice on the TfL website well in advance of the closure starting.

In its current configuration, Colindale Tube station is expected to reach passenger capacity by 2026. As part of the upgrade, the 1960s-built entrance will be replaced with a new, landmark station building which includes a spacious ticket hall and a lift giving step-free access from street to platform for the first time (with existing platform humps giving level access onto trains).

In addition to the temporary closure of Colindale Tube station, there will also be a series of associated planned track closures of the Northern line between Golders Green and Edgware between April and July this year to facilitate the upgrade works. These planned closures are necessary due to the proximity to the track of some of the construction work to upgrade Colindale station - including piling, crane operation and demolition work - meaning it cannot be safely carried out when trains are running. Temporary bus services will run between Golders Green and Edgware stations, and also to Canons Park station for Jubilee line services, during these planned track closures. Weekday and weekend southbound services on the London Underground from Golders Green will not be affected.

Travel advice for customers affected by these closures is available at TfL travel advice - Colindale with more detailed information added as it becomes available.

During the track closures, TfL will take the opportunity to carry out additional track maintenance and engineering works which will help improve overall services along this section of the Northern line, offering a more reliable and comfortable service for customers.

Colindale is one of London's most deprived areas and the redevelopment of the Tube station is central to enabling the building of 11,400 quality new homes for local people. Since 2011, Colindale's population has grown by 70 per cent, making the area around the station the second-fastest growing ward in London after the Stratford Olympic Park in Newham. The upgraded Tube station will increase capacity, improve accessibility and provide a more comfortable and welcoming environment for TfL's customers.

David Rowe, TfL's Director of Investment Delivery Planning, said: ""The major upgrade of Colindale station is set to transform the journeys of many thousands of our customers, making the station more accessible and welcoming, and ensuring it's fit to serve this rapidly growing community for many decades to come. I appreciate that this upgrade will cause some disruption for our customers but we are committed to doing everything we can to ensure that, through our detailed travel advice, they can plan ahead and are able to complete their journeys using the public transport network.""

Cllr Barry Rawlings, Leader of Barnet Council, said: ""Colindale is one of the fastest growing neighbourhoods in London, with a population that has expanded by 70 per cent over the last 10 years. The redevelopment of the Tube station is desperately needed as it reaches capacity by 2026 and, left undone, will stifle our plans to further regenerate the area.

""However, it does mean that TfL will need to close the station while the works take place. Although we appreciate this is the only viable option, we recognise the inconvenience this will cause to those of us who depend on it. Barnet Council will work with TfL to ensure station users will be provided with alternative travel routes and as much advance notice of closures as possible and we look forward to seeing the new, larger, fully accessible station next year.""

Delivering step-free access at Colindale station will continue TfL's work to make the capital's transport network more accessible. Since 2016, TfL has worked to reduce additional journey times for those who need accessible routes by 40 per cent, well on the way to reaching the Mayor of London's accessibility stretch target of 50 per cent by 2030 (from 2041).

TfL will launch a widescale communications campaign ahead of the temporary closure of Colindale station and the associated track closures which will include targeted customer emails, posters and PA announcements at stations. TfL's Journey Planner and TfL Go will also be updated with the latest travel information. TfL is encouraging customers to use these real-time travel tools to plan ahead during these essential closures.",0.324937167708263,Wed,0.94,1.14,1.02,0.98,0.82,0.86,0.91,0.9,0.8,1.010752688172043,1.008849557522124,1.009313154831199,1.0078644888082275,1.0072254335260116,0.9871708305199189,1.0340909090909092,0.9788867562380038,0.9679715302491104,0.9942824471126357,0.9758806177338192,0.9850570962479608,0.9859959211420802,1.0189279005924,0.9966311817814311,1.0558996471971775,0.9419404125286479,0.934117446518367
2024-02-09,Feb, TfL rolls out tougher action on fare evaders and staff abuse with increased penalty fares and body worn cameras,"Fare evasion is a criminal offence and prevents TfL from getting vital income that would benefit all passengers 
 
 




 ""The overwhelming majority of our customers pay the correct fare, however a minority do attempt to travel without a valid ticket""
 
 Siwan Hayward
 TfL's Director of Security, Policing and Enforcement
 


 
Following the Department for Transport's decision to increase the penalty fare to £100 across National Rail, the Mayor has approved an increase to the penalty fare on all TfL services from £80 to £100
Increase in penalty fare will mean fare evaders are covering more of the cost of enforcement
TfL has made body worn video part of its essential kit for all frontline customer facing staff to continue ensuring the safety and protection of customers and colleagues
During 2023, TfL prosecuted 19,614 people for fare evasion, an increase of 56 per cent on 2022, and investigated 421 people for habitual fare evasion who made more than 50,000 irregular journeys across the Underground network
Transport for London (TfL) has today announced tough new action on fare evasion and staff abuse, making body worn video part of its essential kit and increasing the penalty fare from £80 to £100 to act as a further deterrent to fare evasion. TfL has also published new data which shows that it prosecuted 19,614 people for fare evasion in 2023, an increase of 56 per cent on 2022.

TfL is committed to tackling fare evasion as revenue from fares is vital for investment in safe, clean and reliable public transport. Fare evasion is a criminal offence and estimated to cost TfL around £150m a year, and TfL strives to ensure that wherever possible fare evaders themselves, not fare or tax payers, pay the cost of fare evasion. Revenue disputes are also a precursor to approximately half of all reported work-related violence and aggression incidents towards frontline colleagues across the network. TfL does not tolerate any violence, aggression or threatening behaviour towards staff or customers and always seeks the strongest possible action against offenders.

The Mayor has approved an increase to the penalty fare on all TfL services from £80 to £100, reduced to £50 if paid within 21 days. This follows the Department for Transport's decision to increase the penalty fare to £100 across National Rail. This will ensure that there are clear and consistent rules and penalties across the different transport networks in London, and that the penalty fare remains an effective deterrent and that the costs of fare evasion are more effectively absorbed by those who deliberately fail to pay.

Fare evasion is often a trigger for violence and aggression towards staff. TfL has made body worn video (BWV) part of its essential kit for all frontline customer facing staff. BWV cameras film incidents in 60 second-loops and footage is automatically saved once the camera is recording. Research shows that the risk of assaults on colleagues can almost halve when wearing a BWV camera. If an incident is captured on BWV the footage can also provide vital evidence to the police, resulting in better outcomes when offenders go to court. The major rollout of BWV plays a crucial role in TfL's commitment to the safety and protection of its customers and colleagues. Everyone should be able to go about their day without fear or intimidation and TfL will always work with the police to push for the strongest sentences possible for offenders.

The new data on fare evasion shows that TfL investigated 421 people for habitual fare evasion during 2023 who made more than 50,000 fraudulent journeys across the London Underground network, defrauding TfL of more than £300,000 in lost fare revenue. Of these cases, 190 have been prosecuted to date and 189 were found guilty, with the remaining cases pending court action.

TfL has a comprehensive programme in place to deter offenders, including more than 450 officers undertaking ticket inspection and revenue enforcement activity across every mode of transport every day. Station staff also provide insight and information about fare evaders to TfL enforcement and investigations teams to take action.

TfL has improved its ability to investigate and detect the most prolific offenders causing the greatest revenue loss through its irregular travel analysis platform (ITAP). ITAP is a detection system that detects fare evasion and revenue loss from patterns in ticketing and passenger data, identifying people who avoid paying for all or part of their journey. Information generated by ITAP supports a variety of intervention activities that aim to measure and reduce revenue loss and deter people from evading their fares. These activities include targeted email campaigns warning customers that they must pay the correct fare, operational station deployments and a register of regular offenders that ITAP has identified for irregular travel patterns who may be prioritised for further investigation and subsequent prosecution.

A recent case investigated by TfL identified a passenger fare evading by using a Contactless Payment Card and failing to validate correctly for their journeys. An investigation into the travel patterns of the passenger identified 193 occasions of fare evasion which totalled unpaid fares of over £1,200. The passenger recently attended court and pleaded guilty to all the offences. TfL also recently identified a passenger fare evading by using a bank card that had insufficient funds to pay the fare. Analysis of the card's usage showed a regular failure to validate on every journey made in over a year. CCTV footage was obtained to assist in locating and detecting the offender. The passenger attended court and again pleaded guilty to all the offences. He has been ordered to pay TfL £1,795.60.

The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan said: ""TfL relies on revenue from fares to be able to deliver the safe, clean and reliable public transport that Londoners deserve. Fare evasion deprives us of much needed revenue and so I welcome this tough new action from TfL to increase enforcement and ensure more fare evaders are brought to justice. Latest figures show real progress is being made, but I will continue to work with TfL and the British Transport Police to crack down on fare evasion, and build a better, safer and fairer London for everyone.""

Siwan Hayward, TfL's Director of Security, Policing and Enforcement, said: ""The overwhelming majority of our customers pay the correct fare, however a minority do attempt to travel without a valid ticket. Fare evasion is a criminal offence. Fare evasion robs Londoners of vital investment in a safe, frequent and reliable transport. Fare evasion impacts our customers and our staff, and can make public transport feel unsafe. Sadly, fare evasion is often a trigger for violence and aggression towards our colleagues. We strive to ensure that wherever possible it is fare evaders themselves, not fare or tax payers, pay the cost of fare evasion. As today's data shows, anyone who fare evades will be caught and have to pay the consequences.""",0.21652673098002417,Fri,0.92,1.1,0.99,0.96,0.76,0.86,0.86,0.96,0.86,0.989247311827957,0.9734513274336285,0.9796274738067521,0.9872958257713249,0.9335260115606937,0.9871708305199189,0.9772727272727273,1.0441458733205373,1.0405693950177937,0.9731275014293883,0.9416391925501766,0.9560848287112561,0.9658735554044867,0.9443722005490536,0.9966311817814311,0.9978831830654645,1.0047364400305576,1.0041762550072444

TfL introduces bold change after working closely with its Youth Panel over the past year
Young people represent a third of London's population and it is vital that this demographic helps shape TfL policies on diversity, inclusivity and environmental sustainability 
Applications to join the TfL Youth Panel will be open from the end of February
Young Londoners will help shape the capital's transport network as Transport for London (TfL) becomes one of the first UK transport organisations to have representation of people under the age of 25 at senior meetings.

From 21 February, a member of the TfL Youth Panel will actively represent the views of young Londoners at TfL's quarterly Safety, Sustainability and Human Resources Panel (SSHRP) and Customer Service and Operational Performance Panel (CSOPP) meetings.

The young representatives will work with all 30 TfL Youth Panel members to review papers in advance of the meetings and formulate questions and suggestions they wish to put to TfL leaders and panel members.

With more than a third of the capital's population under the age of 25, it is vital that TfL seeks the views of young people to ensure the transport network is safe, accessible and inclusive for this demographic. Ho-Kit Lam, 20, has been appointed to represent the Youth Panel at the SSHRP meetings. Applications to become the first panel representative for the CSOPP meetings will open among current members later this month, with both appointed members to represent the Youth Panel for a year before passing on to another member.

Seb Dance, Deputy Mayor for Transport, said: ""It's great to see that TfL will be ensuring young people's voices are represented at senior meetings from now on. With a third of our capital's population under 25, it is vital that young people's ideas and views are heard, as we work together for a greener, safer and more accessible network for all Londoners.""

Lilli Matson, TfL's Chief Health, Safety and Environment Officer, said: ""To help ensure London thrives and we have a transport network that is safe, green, connected, affordable and accessible to all we must listen to the views of young people. This is why having young voices represented at our senior meetings, where we plan policies and initiatives to improve London's transport network is so vital.""  

TfL Youth Panel member, Ho-Kit Lam, said: ""As a young Londoner, I have seen how diverse our communities are. We are looking forward to working with TfL's senior leaders to make London more inclusive and give a chance for all to decide on how London will be safer, greener and more sustainable in the future.""

Last autumn TfL's Youth Panel launched an independent report focusing on making London's transport network more equitable, inclusive and environmentally sustainable. The report, Tomorrow's TfL: The Youth Panel's vision for the future was the result of 12 months' research that saw TfL's Youth Panel take an in-depth look at these topics and engage with experts and thought leaders to produce their findings, including holding public hearings at City Hall.

The report sets out nine policy recommendations on how TfL and the Mayor of London can make transport in London more sustainable and inclusive. This included TfL Youth Panel representation at senior meetings, introducing Youth Travel Ambassadors across London and publishing proposals to overcome the barriers to sustainable travel, with a focus on ethnic minority groups, people with physical and mental health conditions, and those from deprived backgrounds.

TfL supports the findings of Youth Panel in the Tomorrow's TfL: The Youth Panel's vision for the future report. This report highlights important issues and evidence that are central to TfL's vision of being the strong green heartbeat for London and for progressing environmental and social sustainability. Building on existing efforts and progress to date, TfL will work closely with the Youth Panel to take forward these recommendations and to explore other key challenges facing young people in the capital. 

TfL's recently published ambitious new customer plan, Equity in Motion, is a key part of this response to the Youth Panel's recommendations. The plan commits to more than 80 actions to ensure as many Londoners as possible can access and benefit from public transport and that London's transport network is welcoming and inclusive. The wide-ranging commitments in the plan cover key areas for improvements around accessible travel, keeping customers safe, understanding customers, affordable travel, inclusive information and connecting Londoners.",0.31281820985226777,Tue,0.92,1.14,1,0.97,0.84,0.78,0.85,1,0.9,0.989247311827957,1.008849557522124,0.9895227008149011,0.9975801572897762,1.0317919075144508,0.8953409858203916,0.9659090909090908,1.0876519513755598,1.0889679715302492,0.9731275014293883,0.9758806177338192,0.965742251223491,0.9759347382732835,1.0437798006068486,0.9039213044064143,0.9862798902391219,1.0466004583651642,1.0508821273331628

The new names have been chosen through engagement with customers, stakeholders, historians, industry experts and local communities 
New names, line colours and maps will make it easier for customers to navigate the London Overground and further build ridership, while celebrating London's diverse communities and histories 
In a historic re-imagining of London's public transport network, each of London's six overground lines will for the first time ever be given a unique name and line colour. This significant change, which will include a major update to London's world-famous Tube map, will make it easier for customers to navigate London's transport network while also celebrating the city's diverse culture and history. 

Research by Transport for London (TfL) has shown that some customers find the London Overground network confusing and would find it easier to navigate if it wasn't one single colour and name. 

Each route will be represented by a new line name and colour on the Tube map, on train line diagrams, at stations and on digital journey planning tools, such as TfL Go.  The much-loved orange roundel will continue to be used across the London Overground network. 

The new line names are: 

The Lioness line: Euston to Watford Junction. The Lioness line, which runs through Wembley, honours the historic achievements and lasting legacy created by the England women's football team that continues to inspire and empower the next generation of women and girls in sport. It will be yellow parallel lines on the map. 
The Mildmay line: Stratford to Richmond/Clapham Junction. The Mildmay line, which runs through Dalston, honours the small charitable hospital in Shoreditch that has cared for Londoners over many years, notably its pivotal role in the HIV/AIDS crisis in the 1980s, which made it the valued and respected place it is for the LGBTQ+ community today. It will be blue parallel lines on the map. 
The Windrush line: Highbury & Islington to Clapham Junction/New Cross/Crystal Palace/West Croydon. The Windrush line runs through areas with strong ties to Caribbean communities today, such as Dalston Junction, Peckham Rye and West Croydon and honours the Windrush generation who continue to shape and enrich London's cultural and social identity today. It will be red parallel lines on the map. 
The Weaver line: Liverpool Street to Cheshunt/Enfield Town/Chingford. The Weaver line runs through Liverpool Street, Spitalfields, Bethnal Green and Hackney - areas of London known for their textile trade, shaped over the centuries by diverse migrant communities and individuals. It will be maroon parallel lines on the map.    
The Suffragette line: Gospel Oak to Barking Riverside. The Suffragette line celebrates how the working-class movement in the East End, fought for votes for woman and paved the way for women's rights. The line runs to Barking, home of the longest surviving Suffragette Annie Huggett, who died at 103. It will be green parallel lines on the map.   
The Liberty line: Romford to Upminster. The Liberty line celebrates the freedom that is a defining feature of London and references the historical independence of the people of Havering, through which it runs. It will be grey parallel lines on the map. 
Stakeholders, customers, historians, industry experts and communities have played a key role in suggesting the new names through independent engagement, which took place ahead of the decision for the final six names. This was key for the Mayor, as London's diverse history and culture have always played a significant role in shaping the city and it was important for the line names, which will be used for years to come, to reflect this. 

The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan said: ""This is a hugely exciting moment, transforming how we think about London's transport network. 

""Giving each of the Overground lines distinct colours and identities will make it simpler and easier for passengers to get around. In re-imagining London's tube map, we are also honouring and celebrating different parts of London's unique local history and culture. 

""The new names and colours have been chosen through engagement with passengers, historians and local communities, reflecting the heritage and diversity of our amazing city.""  

Andy Lord, London's Transport Commissioner, said: ""The London Overground is one of the most successful railways in the country and has grown to carry more than three million customers a week. The network, which has grown quite considerably since 2007, is currently shown as a complicated network of orange on route maps.   This can be confusing for customers less familiar with the network and could be a barrier for some wanting to use the London Overground. These new names and line colours will simplify the maps and routes for our customers, and it is hoped it will encourage more people to make the most of our services.  It is also a great way to tell the stories of some important parts of London's cultural diversity."" 

Mark Bullingham, Chief Executive Officer for The Football Association, said: ""We're so pleased to see the Mayor of London and Transport for London recognise the historic achievements of our England women's team with the newly named Lioness line. The line honours the incredible victory in the UEFA Women's EURO in 2022 at Wembley Stadium connected by EE, and the lasting legacy this team is creating in inspiring the next generation.""

Geoff Coleman, Chief Executive Officer for Mildmay Mission Hospital, said: ""We are deeply honoured that the Mildmay line was chosen as one of the new London Overground lines names in recognition of the work of the dedicated doctors, nurses and support staff at the Mildmay Hospital.  From its humble origins in the 1860s - serving the poorest people of the East End - to its pivotal role during the HIV/AIDS crisis in the 80s and 90s, Mildmay has evolved into an internationally renowned rehab centre, and our dedicated team continues to serve people from across London. More than just tracks and stations, the Mildmay line symbolises a journey of acceptance, love, and belonging - a vibrant thread connecting our collective past, present, and future."" 

Arthur Torrington CBE, Co-founder and Director of the Windrush Foundation, said: ""Windrush Foundation congratulates Transport for London for creating a new interest in travel on the Windrush line as part of the London Overground line naming project. We are reminded of the iconic journey of Empire Windrush and the contributions the Caribbean community have made to the capital over many decades. We are pleased to be recognised this way and look forward to seeing Londoners using the Windrush line."" 

James Gaselee, Clerk for Worshipful Company of Weavers, said: ""We are delighted that one of the newly named London Overground lines will be called the Weaver line in recognition of the silk weaving trade that was centred on Spitalfields; this is not however purely historic as the name of the line will also shine a light on the silk weaving, textile and fashion industries that continue to flourish in London and across the country"". 

Jemima Olchawski, Chief Executive of the Fawcett Society, said: ""We owe so much to the courageous suffragettes and suffragists who campaigned hard and at significant personal cost for women to have the vote and we at Fawcett are delighted that their activism is being recognised by TfL. We hope that commuters on the Suffragette line will pause to think about these amazing women and the work they did to build our democracy. The Fawcett Society, founded by Millicent Fawcett in 1866, and strengthened by our members today is proud to continue this legacy of feminist campaigning for a more equal society. The naming of the Suffragette line is a wonderful way to pay tribute to the women who have gone before us and to inspire the next generation of feminist campaigners, as our work isn't yet done!"" 

Julie Frost, BID Director for Romford BID, said: ""The Romford BID welcome the announcement that the Romford to Upminster branch line now has a new name; the Liberty line. This is a very fitting name as it speaks to our Borough's centuries old status as a Royal Liberty. Back then, this shared status helped to bound our different communities together. What better way to keep alive the spirit of this association than by renaming a key piece of our local transport infrastructure.  We hope passengers will be further encouraged to use the new Liberty line to come and see all the many things we have on offer in Romford"". 

London Overground first began in 2007 when TfL took over four under-used suburban railway lines. The network has since grown, meaning it has now become represented by a spaghetti of orange on the Tube maps. The Mayor was committed to help simplify this for customers with a new line name and colour for each line, and with names chosen to showcases London's rich history, heritage and diversity. ",0.3245116502637195,Thu,0.93,1.11,1,0.96,0.85,0.8,0.82,0.94,0.84,1,0.9823008849557524,0.9895227008149011,0.9872958257713249,1.0440751445086704,0.9182984469952735,0.9318181818181818,1.0223928342930262,1.0163701067615658,0.9837049742710121,0.9501995488460873,0.965742251223491,0.9658735554044867,1.0562057506140732,0.9270987737501685,0.951470011760094,0.9838044308632543,0.9808233188442853
2024-02-15,Feb, Places for London teams up with Construction Youth Trust to inspire the next generation,"Partnership will enable thousands of young people learn about the built environment and the exciting careers it offers
 
 




 ""We are delighted to be partnering with Places for London to inspire young people to discover the wide range of career opportunities the built environment has to offer""

 CEO at Construction Youth Trust
 


 
Follows research that shows a lack of interest amongst students, particularly young women, in working in the built environment
Data also showed that only half of students and less than two-thirds of parents thought the built environment affected their lives, while half of teachers had said they'd not heard of the built environment
Places for London (Transport for London's wholly owned commercial property company) has announced that it has teamed up with Construction Youth Trust on its educational engagement programme.

The programme is a collaboration between Places for London and its partners, including Barratt London, The Earls Court Development Company, Grainger plc and Helical plc, and aims to inspire the next generation of young people into the built environment sector, which encompasses both the construction and real estate sectors. Working with its partners, Places for London will be starting on 20,000 homes over the next ten years, making it one of the largest developers in London. Places for London is keen to use the scale of its programme to encourage new people into the industry. This is vital because research has shown that an additional 22,800 workers are expected to be required to meet construction demand in Greater London by 2027*.

Following a competitive process, Places for London selected Construction Youth Trust as its Educational Engagement Programme delivery partner. It will help bring together schools, young people and employers (including role models from across the built environment industry), so that students, as well as teachers and parents, can learn more about the industry and the impact it has. Over the course of the next three years, Places for London and Construction Youth Trust aims to reach 6,750 young Londoners through a range of inspirational workshops and intensive programmes to support young people progress into built environment careers.

Through the partnership, Places for London and its partners will be directly supporting 250 young people to progress into an education, training or employment outcome related to the built environment. This could be an 18-year-old starting a degree level apprenticeship, or a 16-year-old going onto study a construction T-Level.

Thomas Glover, Construction Skills Manager at Places for London, said: ""Alongside our development partners, we're excited to work with Construction Youth Trust to engage more young people and their teachers, and show them that the built environment offers something for everyone. We can show young people how they have a real chance to shape London and, more widely, the world around them. As an industry, we need to make sure we've got a pipeline of brilliant and diverse talent coming through to guarantee the places around us are the best they can be.""

Carol Lynch, CEO at Construction Youth Trust, said: ""We are delighted to be partnering with Places for London to inspire young people to discover the wide range of career opportunities the built environment has to offer. Our aim is to support a new generation of young Londoners to become the leaders and professionals of the future by connecting them with employers who recognise that it makes business sense to invest in the capital's diverse young talent.""

Jessica Fabian, Commercial Real Estate apprentice at Places for London, said: ""I love working in the built environment sector and as part of my degree apprenticeship, I've been involved in a variety of projects - including working with the business tenants across our arches estate. There are so many different opportunities in the industry that I hadn't realised existed before I did a work placement at a property firm while at school. I thought working in property meant that you had to be an estate agent - I couldn't have been more wrong!""

Grace O'Connor, Commercial Real Estate apprentice at Places for London, added: ""Through the work Places for London has been doing with schools, I got to learn all about property development and visit the construction site near to my school where they have been building new homes with Barratt London. This inspired me to apply for my apprenticeship at TfL, where I am actually getting the chance to work within the property industry, while also studying for a degree.""

Places for London has been delivering its education engagement programme by working together with some of the UK's leading property developers, such as Barratt London, Earls Court Development Company, Grainger plc and Helical plc. It is vital that the industry is taking action, as research undertaken by YouGov last year for Places for London showed that only 36 per cent of those surveyed between 11-18 in London and the South-East were interested in having a job in the built environment sector.** The data was even more stark when broken down by gender, with just 30 per cent of female students being interested, compared to 42 per cent of male students.**

Despite the sizeable influence of the built environment on everyday lives, only half of students (51 per cent) thought the built environment had an impact on their lives**. A similar proportion of parents - at 57 per cent - believed the same***. This is exacerbated by the findings that, of the teachers surveyed, half (51 per cent) had never heard of the built environment****.

The Educational Engagement Programme is hoping to increase awareness and understanding of the built environment. It will also increase access to role models already working within the sector, with less than a fifth of the young people surveyed having ever met a civil engineer (18 per cent), real estate surveyor (14 per cent), construction project manager (13 per cent) or property manager (14 per cent)**. The ability to interact with those working in the sector, ask them questions and learn more about what they do will help increase the understanding of young people about the built environment and the potential careers they might be interested in. So far, Places for London through its educational engagement programme has facilitated more than 1,300 hours of industry expert volunteering time.

2024-02-16,Feb, Bidders shortlisted in the process to find the next operator of the Elizabeth line,"Four bidders shortlisted to become next operator of transformational railway
 
 




 ""The Elizabeth line has had a transformational impact, providing new, more direct journey options for customers, including at ten new central London stations""
 
 Howard Smith
 Elizabeth line Director
 


 
Next Elizabeth line operator to build on the success of the railway since launching in 2022
Growing reliability will be a focus for new operator along with maintaining customer satisfaction
Transport for London (TfL) has confirmed four bidders have been shortlisted as part of the procurement process to operate the Elizabeth line from May 2025, when the current contract with MTR Elizabeth line expires. 

The Elizabeth line is the most significant addition to London's transport network in a generation and it has been transforming life and travel in London and the South East, providing new journey options, reducing journey times, creating additional capacity and transforming accessibility. 

The Elizabeth line opened in May 2022 and provides services to Reading, Heathrow, Shenfield and Abbey Wood, running through central London with up to 24 trains per hour at peak time.  Since May 2022 there have been more than 300 million journeys on the railway.

The shortlisted bidders are:

Arriva UK Trains
First Keolis Elizabeth line (a joint venture between First Group PLC and Keolis SA)
GTS Rail Operations Limited (A joint venture between Go Ahead Holdings Limited, Sumitomo Corporation and Tokyo Metro Co. Ltd)
MTR Corporation (UK) Limited
Howard Smith, Elizabeth line Director, said: ""The Elizabeth line has had a transformational impact, providing new, more direct journey options for customers, including at ten new central London stations.

""We have introduced new, more spacious trains, which run more frequently through 41 stations that were either newly built or modernised, supporting hundreds of millions of customer journeys each year. The new Elizabeth line operator will play a major role in supporting us to continue that growth and success, providing high levels of customer service and satisfaction.""

The next operator will build on the success of the Elizabeth line, collaborating with key partners to optimise reliability, as well as sustaining the high levels of customer satisfaction and growth. They will also need to work closely with TfL, Network Rail and HS2 preparing for the operation of Elizabeth line services to the new superhub station at Old Oak Common.

2024-02-20,Feb, Work to resume at Northolt as TfL confirms the next Tube stations to be prioritised for step-free access,"Work will resume at Northolt Tube station on the western end of the Central line to make it step-free, after being paused due to the pandemic
 
 




 ""To build a fairer, more equal borough, Camden must become as accessible as possible.""
 
 Councillor Adam Harrison
 Cabinet member for a sustainable Camden
 


 
Construction is scheduled to start at Northolt station early next year
TfL also plans to start design work on making North Acton (Central line) and West Hampstead (Jubilee line) step-free while also addressing capacity constraints, building on feasibility work that started last year
Work will resume to make Northolt Tube station, on the West Ruislip branch of the Central line, step-free after it was paused due to the pandemic. Transport for London (TfL) also plans to start design work on making North Acton on the Central line and West Hampstead on the Jubilee line step-free, while also addressing capacity constraints.

This follows TfL confirming in summer 2023 that it would be reviewing ten Underground stations, spread across the capital, for potential step-free access.

The ten stations, which included Northolt, North Acton and West Hampstead, were identified using an approach focused on benefits, costs, funding opportunities and impact on customers. The approach was also influenced by feedback from accessibility campaigners and TfL's consultation on step-free access, which attracted 5,500 responses. This feedback highlighted the importance of TfL addressing the gaps in areas that have few step-free stations.

Construction work was about to start at Northolt Tube station to make it step-free when the pandemic hit. Work has now been completed to re-analyse the design, construction and costing and TfL is able to confirm that this scheme will go ahead, with a construction start date of early 2025 following awarding of contracts for the next phase, completion of remaining design activities and site mobilisation. Northolt is also on the Superloop SL9 route, linking Heathrow to Harrow. TfL has one of the most accessible bus networks in the world with all routes served by low-floor vehicles and an access ramp and dedicated space for wheelchair users. Making Northolt step-free will open up new journey options for those travelling to Heathrow Airport using Superloop services.

Seb Dance, Deputy Mayor for Transport, said: ""London's diversity is one of its biggest strengths and the Mayor wants everyone to be able to participate in and enjoy all that our great city has to offer.

""The Mayor, TfL and I are determined to make London's transport network as accessible as possible. We are committed to increasing the proportion of step-free Tube stations and I'm delighted that TfL has confirmed the next stations where work will get underway. This is just one of the ways we are working to build a better, fairer city for all Londoners.""

Alex Williams, TfL's Chief Customer and Strategy Officer, said: ""Reducing the journey time difference for those who rely on step-free access is a key goal of the Mayor's Transport Strategy. This will help create a fairer, more accessible and inclusive transport network, opening up more of London to everyone. We've been working hard to identify which Tube stations will be prioritised next for step-free access which is a critical component of delivering a more equitable customer experience for everyone who uses our services. I'm really pleased that we're now able to confirm that work will resume at Northolt and that we're starting design work at North Acton and West Hampstead as the next stations to be upgraded, building on feasibility work that started last year.""

Councillor Adam Harrison, Cabinet member for a sustainable Camden, said: ""To build a fairer, more equal borough, Camden must become as accessible as possible. Bringing in step-free access at West Hampstead Underground station will help us along this journey. This council used its powers in the planning process from the nearby O2 redevelopment to successfully negotiate funding for this massive advance for the NW6 community and the area's many visitors and workers.""

Councillor Deirdre Costigan, Ealing Council's deputy leader and cabinet member for climate action, said: ""Since 2021 Ealing Council has been pressing TfL to re-start work, stopped during Covid, to install lifts in Northolt station. So this is fantastic news that will delight local parents and disabled and older residents who will now find it much easier to use one of our busiest stations. North Acton station is also a priority for us and it's great to see plans for lifts at this station progress to the next stage, ensuring more of our borough is accessible to all of our residents and visitors.""

Emma Vogelmann, Policy and Public Affairs Manager at Transport for All, said: ""In our latest report, we found that a lack of step-free access was the single most significant barrier for disabled Londoners using the Underground. Not only does this render whole swathes of the network unusable, but impacts our journey times, health, work, education, and more. The resumption of work to make Northolt step-free, as well as upgrades across the rest of the network, are therefore vital, and we are encouraged to see TfL continuing to work with disabled people to make the capital truly accessible for all.""

John McGeachy, Campaigns Manager at AgeUK London, said: ""Step-free stations have the ability to transform the lives of older and disabled Londoners as well as many others. We really welcome the news work will resume to make Northolt station step-free. Increasing the number of step-free stations on the Underground network will open the capital up to people that have faced too many barriers for too long.""

TfL will provide a full overview of the London Underground step-free access programme later in 2024, once the feasibility work is completed and discussions with key stakeholders have concluded, including funding partners. TfL will make recommendations on which of the other current schemes progress and which additional stations have been selected for feasibility work in 2024/25.

Since 2016, TfL has worked to reduce additional journey times for those who need accessible routes by 40 per cent, well on the way to reaching the Mayor of London's accessibility stretch target of 50 per cent by 2030 (from 2041). The Government confirmed in December 2023 that £43.1m from the Levelling Up Fund had been allocated to the upgrade of Colindale (Northern line) and Leyton (Central line) Underground stations, alongside contributions from Barnet and Waltham Forest councils, local developers and TfL. This means both stations will become step-free for the first time. Work has started in the vicinity of Colindale Tube station to prepare for its major upgrade and the construction contract for Leyton station is expected to be awarded in summer 2024. Work continues with third parties to deliver step-free access later this year at Knightsbridge and Paddington Tube stations (Bakerloo line entrance).",0.32053671716728843,Tue,0.94,1.14,1.01,0.98,0.84,0.99,0.92,0.91,0.83,1.010752688172043,1.008849557522124,0.9994179278230502,1.0078644888082275,1.0317919075144508,1.1363943281566509,1.0454545454545454,0.9897632757517595,1.004270462633452,0.9942824471126357,0.9758806177338192,0.9753996737357259,0.9859959211420802,1.0437798006068486,1.1472847325158335,1.0675029400235203,0.9524064171122996,0.9691468507628057
2024-02-21,Feb, TfL advises southbound traffic closure through Blackwall Tunnel in March and April,"Southbound traffic will need to seek alternative routes across the weekends of 16-18 March and 13-15 April
 
 




 ""We appreciate that these planned weekend works will have an impact on some drivers and are doing everything in our power to limit potential disruption and complete these essential works as quickly as possible, including ensuring a northbound route through the Blackwall Tunnel is maintained throughout""
 
 Carl Eddleston
 Director of Network Management and Resilience at TfL
 


 
Planned closures follow recent successful work to allow TfL and Riverlinx CJV to carry out drainage and gantry installation works on the northbound Blackwall Tunnel approach to support the new Silvertown Tunnel
Northbound traffic will not be affected by the closures and will be diverted via the normal southbound tunnel
Route 108 will be temporarily split and terminate at Canning Town station and North Greenwich, with customers using the Jubilee line to cross the river to complete their journeys with subsequent refunds available if required
Transport for London (TfL) has today advised drivers that the Blackwall Tunnel will be closed to southbound traffic across the weekends of 16-18 March and 13-15 April to help support carriageway works on the northbound Blackwall Tunnel approach. The new closure will follow the previously announced southbound closure across the weekend of 24-26 February.

The works, which are required to implement the road configuration for the new Silvertown Tunnel which will open in 2025, will see new over-height vehicle gantries installed, which are necessary to protect the tunnel, as well as resurfacing works as part of the final road configuration. The three planned weekend closures will start at 00:01 on the Saturday morning and will be reopened by 05:00 on the Monday morning at the latest.

The Silvertown Tunnel will provide a public transport-focused river crossing with zero-emission bus links across the Thames. Once open in 2025, the crossing, which is within the Ultra-Low Emission Zone and will be subject to a user charge, will also reduce congestion and improve the reliability and resilience of the Blackwall Tunnel, which will improve overall air quality in the local area.

Across the weekends, the Blackwall Tunnel will be closed for southbound traffic and drivers will need to take alternative routes. Northbound traffic will not be affected by these closures as traffic will be diverted through the southbound Blackwall Tunnel. However, there will be no access to Tunnel Avenue from the A102 at Pear Island across the weekend of 16-18 March due to the works. The northbound on-slip on Blackwall Lane will also be closed and a signed diversion via the Woolwich Flyover roundabout will be in place. During the weekend of the 24-26 February, northbound traffic will also be diverted from the A102 via Millennium Way to the Blackwall Tunnel entrance from 22:00 on Saturday until 10:00 on Sunday to allow for additional works to install new gantries across all lanes of the A102.

Drivers are advised to plan their routes in advance, checking before they travel so they can consider any other potential traffic impacts or restrictions, such as the height and weight limits at Rotherhithe Tunnel and Tower Bridge, both of which are outside the Congestion Charge zone. Traffic around Rotherhithe Tunnel and along the A13 Commercial Road are expected to be heavier than normal over the weekends due to the closures.

Drivers of HGVs, as well as vans more than two metres in height or weighing more than two tonnes, are advised to consider routes away from central London across the weekend where possible. To help inform drivers, additional variable messaging signs will be placed on the main roads approaching the Blackwall Tunnel. TfL has also worked with third party app providers, such as Waze, to help ensure drivers who regularly use the Blackwall Tunnel are alerted to the southbound closure and that the closure is shown in any route-planning over the weekend. TfL will also take the opportunity to carry out works within and around the tunnel, to help deliver future maintenance work more efficiently and ensure the tunnel can continue to safely operate. 

Carl Eddleston, Director of Network Management and Resilience at TfL, said: ""We appreciate that these planned weekend works will have an impact on some drivers and are doing everything in our power to limit potential disruption and complete these essential works as quickly as possible, including ensuring a northbound route through the Blackwall Tunnel is maintained throughout.""

The route 108, the only bus route that operates through the Blackwall Tunnel, will be split in two, operating between both Lewisham and North Greenwich and between Canning Town and Stratford. Customers are advised to then change onto the Jubilee line to cross the river to complete their journeys. TfL will also ensure that customers of the route 108 who then use the Jubilee line as part of their journey over the weekend will avoid being charged for the Tube section of their journey via an automatic refund which will be processed after the weekend. The Mayor's Hopper fare will also mean that customers won't be charged for any additional bus journeys on the other side of the river, providing they begin within an hour of touching in on the first bus. From 00:01 on the Monday mornings of the closure, northbound buses will return to their normal route and southbound buses will be diverted via Tower Bridge until the tunnel is re-opened to southbound traffic.

Work on delivering the new Silvertown Tunnel, which will open in 2025, continues to progress. Both of the 1.1km tunnels have now been fully tunnelled and the 'cut and cover' sections are now in advanced stages of being covered. Throughout 2024 work will continue to install the safety critical systems within the tunnel, as well as complete work on the tunnel portals. Work is also progressing on the new road layout around Tidal Basin Roundabout in Newham, including new walking and cycling paths to make it easier for people accessing the Royal Docks via the Lower Lea Crossing.

2024-02-21,Feb, Thousands of care leavers aged 18-25 to benefit from half-price bus and tram travel in London as new concession opens,"Care leavers aged between 18 and 25 and who live in London can now apply for half price bus and tram travel, after a new travel concession opened for applications today.
 
 




 ""I'm delighted that we have been able to launch this new concession, which will directly support those Londoners leaving care and help them transition into independent living in the capital""
 
 Andy Lord
  London's Transport Commissioner
 


 
Announced by the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan in October 2023, the new concession will support between 15,000 - 16,000 care leavers across London aged between 18 to 25 who are now eligible to apply for the travel concession, and will directly support those who have left care once they turn 18 by allowing them to be able to travel more affordably while they transition into independent living.

The new concession is part of the Pan London Care Leavers' Compact, a common core offer of support designed with care-experienced young people and agreed by the Mayor, TfL, London boroughs and London's health services.

London's children in care can still face many obstacles and many remain particularly vulnerable once they leave care. This means fewer care leavers go onto further training or university and can face complex challenges after they leave care.  

Analysis by The Children's Society suggests that across London there are around 15,270 young people a year living in care, many of whom will often find it difficult to navigate living independently alongside having a job, undertaking training, or remaining in the education system post-18. Nationally, nearly 42 per cent of care leavers aged 19-21 were known not to be in education, employment, or training. This compares to around 11 per cent of all 19 to 21-year-olds.

Furthermore, where care leavers do remain in education or seek a job or apprenticeship, the costs of doing so can often be an extra financial burden for them. These include the costs of travel to and from work or education; clothing for interviews; specialist tools and equipment; and course fees. Care leavers also require extra support in sustaining employment, whether through expert advice and skills development; access to subsidised travel; or other job-related expenses. To support care leavers effectively, all of these support sources need to work closely together.

The new concession will sit alongside other travel concessions provided by TfL, aimed at a wide range of people from young people to older people and those seeking employment. As well as the discount, holders of the new concession will be able to benefit from the Mayor's Hopper fare, which allows unlimited bus and tram journeys within an hour for the price of a single journey. The Mayor has also frozen TfL fares until March 2025, further helping to support Londoners struggling with the cost of living and London's recovery from the pandemic.

To check eligibility during application processing, TfL will be working with London Councils via the London Innovation and Improvement Alliance (LIIA), who represent all 33 London boroughs and facilitate collaboration that benefits children and young people.

The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan said: ""Leaving care can be extremely challenging or daunting for young adults who can feel unprepared for the transition to independent living. Many care leavers lack the resources needed to continue training or gain meaningful employment once leaving care, which can, in turn, lead to both financial and emotional hardship.

""That's why I'm pleased to announce that today my new care leavers travel concession has opened for applications, meaning care leavers aged between 18 and 25 who live in London can apply for half-price bus and tram travel. This will give these young people a helping hand to thrive in this next stage of their lives as we continue to build a better, fairer London for everyone.""

Andy Lord, London's Transport Commissioner said: ""I'm delighted that we have been able to launch this new concession, which will directly support those Londoners leaving care and help them transition into independent living in the capital. We remain keen to ensure that fares on public transport remain as affordable as possible, while ensuring that TfL can continue to run clean, green and safe services and support London's continued economic recovery. Our wide range of concessions, as well as the Hopper fare, are a big part of our inclusive transport offer that seeks to ensure everyone can get around the city and enjoy all that it has to offer.""

Zhane Decembre and Louisa Foyle from the Pan London Children in Care Council at Partnership for Young London, said: ""The Pan London Children in Care Council at Partnership for Young London are pleased that the Mayor and TfL have launched this new concession for all care leavers across London. This offer will massively contribute to care leavers who are on a low income as they essentially have little support. Ultimately this is the one huge step within the Pan London Compact for Care Leavers which we hope to continue to expand and create as many new offers for care leavers across London creating consistency for people and showing that they really matter.

""This initiative not only eases the financial burden on care leavers but also fosters a sense of acceptance and recognition within society. It's a positive stride towards improving their access to essential transportation services. This effort reflects a commitment to equality and social equity for all members of our community it also begins with every journey matters when you are care experienced.""

Jacqui McShannon, Strategic Director Children's Services and ALDCS Strategic Lead for Care Leaving, Hammersmith and Fulham, said: ""London's Directors of Children's Services share the strong commitment to an enhanced and consistent offer to support all care experienced young people across London. We are proud to be part of the pan London partnership led by care experienced young people, and to be working so effectively with the GLA,  voluntary, statutory, and business partners to deliver our joint ambition to improve the lives of all of London's cared for children and young people."" 

Lizzie Takyi-Akyaa, Lead Youth Worker at Carney's Community Centre said: ""The transition from childhood to adulthood is often seen as bold and exciting, but for many care leavers, it can be daunting and challenging.  As a Lead Youth Worker, I often come across care leavers who feel stuck and hopeless about their future, with the limited support from local and central government. This new concession initiative by the Mayor of London and TFL is a real acknowledgment and recognition of the complex struggles care leavers often face as they begin the next chapter of their lives. This is an opportunity to remove barriers which prevent these young adults to flourish and reach their full potential."" 

Alongside this new discount the Greater London Authority (GLA) continues to support children in care and care leavers through a range of schemes. In 2018, the Mayor of London signed the GLA up to the Care Leaver Covenant, making a number of accompanying pledges around GLA activity.  The GLA are also partners on the Pan London Care Leavers' Compact, which provides a framework for developing consistency, breadth and quality in the support offered to London's care leavers. Each London borough currently has a care leaver offer, but these are individual to each area and therefore the support offered varies. By working in partnership to adopt a common core offer across London, care leavers can receive better support in terms of access to health, education, transport, housing and mentoring.  Through the London Compact, the TfL care leaver concession links with offers from health and borough partners to offer a support package that is more than the sum of its parts.

2024-02-26,Feb, TfL collaborates with Google Arts and Culture to launch online collection,"TfL and Google Arts launch collection of historical and contemporary content about London's transport past
 
 




 ""London's world-renowned transport network is one of our most treasured institutions and this collaboration with Google Arts and Culture is a fantastic way to see its incredible history in a new light""
 
 Justine Simons OBE
 Deputy Mayor for Culture and the Creative Industries
 


 
Today (Monday 26 February), Transport for London (TfL) joins more than 200 UK cultural institutions who have collaborated with Google Arts & Culture to share their collection and stories online.

TfL's collaboration with Google Arts and Culture, whose mission is to preserve the world's art and culture and to make it accessible to anyone, anywhere for free, will result in the online availability of more than 2,000 documents and images from its Corporate Archive collections.

The collection, covering the first London Underground line opening in 1863 to the modern day, includes more than 400 maps that have been digitised by Google Arts & Culture. Many of these documents are available online for the first time, which TfL hopes will provide interest to Londoners, academics and casual historians of all ages.

Pulling from the Archives, Google Arts and Culture users around the world will be able to see a fascinating timeline of London's transport throughout the centuries through 90+ digital stories bringing the archives to life. Maps prepared for the 1937 and 1953 coronations, cartoons by Harry Beck (designer of the Tube map), and extracts from oral histories with persons who sheltered in the Tube during WWII, are some of the things included in TfL's Google Arts and Culture profile.

Themed sections will allow Google Arts & Culture users to not only examine the organisation's long history but will also provide wider access to more recent milestones such as, imagery and documentation of TfL's involvement in the London 2012 Olympics, and Queen Elizabeth II opening the Elizabeth Line in 2023. Other sections include a crossword inspired by the 1932 TfL staff magazine, recipes, and vintage quizzes that users can undertake.

The collection has been sourced from TfL's Corporate Archives, who are responsible for safeguarding the corporate memory of TfL and its predecessor companies. To provide a rounded view of the organisation for Google Arts & Culture users, the collection will be regularly updated to keep material relevant, to ensure that some of the pioneering and innovative projects TfL is currently working on are equally preserved for the future.

Tamara Thornhill, Corporate Archivist for Transport for London, said: 

'The cultural influence of London's transport system is tangible across London and around the world.

'We have worked on this online collection for more than three years, with the help of Google Arts & Culture's digitisation team, and are thrilled to be able to utilise this platform to exhibit the range of the collections. This collaboration is a real step forward in preserving culture, making our collection more accessible, and helping to open never before seen content to a wider audience.'

Justine Simons OBE, Deputy Mayor for Culture and the Creative Industries, said: 

'London's world-renowned transport network is one of our most treasured institutions and this collaboration with Google Arts and Culture is a fantastic way to see its incredible history in a new light. By digitally preserving its archive collections and making them accessible, we are opening up the fascinating history of London's transport system and its ongoing impact on our city to a much broader audience, as we help to build a better London for all.'

Amit Sood, Director and Founder of Google Arts & Culture, said:

'This new collaboration with the Transport for London Corporate Archives opens up a fascinating historical world and allows anyone to explore the evolution of London's iconic transport system. The archive holds extraordinary stories - stories of engineering ingenuity, design innovation, and communities across decades - and we are thrilled to help share them with the world and preserve a vital piece of London's cultural heritage for generations to come.'

2024-02-28,Feb, Hundreds of musicians showcase their talents as they vie to become a busker in TfL’s stations,"Around 280 musicians auditioning to busk on the TfL network in the first opportunity since the pandemic
 
 




 ""We have been blown away by the response to our call out for more buskers, and there's a palpable feeling of excitement at all the stations where the auditions are taking place as musicians tune up to showcase their talents""
 
 Emma Strain
 TfL's Customer Director
 


 
Successful musicians will join more than 200 existing buskers on the Tube, Overground and Elizabeth line
Buskers have been entertaining those travelling on the London transport network for more than 20 years
Stations across the Transport for London (TfL) network have come alive with the sounds of music as auditions for a new cohort of buskers are underway after applications opened in late 2023 for the first time after the pandemic.

Around 280 talented musicians are performing to a panel of judges at Bank, Blackfriars, Canary Wharf, Farringdon and Southwark stations over the next fortnight, shortlisted from more than 450 applicants. Musicians from all genres were encouraged to apply in the autumn to reflect the cultural diversity of London. Each prospective busker has a 10-minute slot to convince a panel, which includes a professional musician and station staff. The audition will assess each musician's repertoire, musical ability, and performance styles.

The auditions are now underway, with around 30 musicians to be put through their paces each day. The process is managed by TfL with support from Found in Music, which runs Busk in London, a programme supported by the Mayor of London. The newly selected musicians will join more than 200 existing buskers later in the spring and play at more than 40 pitches on the Tube, Overground and Elizabeth line networks, including two pitches that opened at Bond Street station last year.

TfL's Licensed Busking Scheme has been running for more than 20 years, with auditions opening to new musicians every few years.

Justine Simons OBE, Deputy Mayor for Culture and the Creative Industries, said: ""Music is the beating heart of London and buskers bring our city to life everyday, making live music accessible to everyone. So I am delighted to see the return of TfL's busking auditions. We know the important part music can play in people's lives and the difference a song can make to our day. This is a fantastic opportunity for musicians to showcase their talents to Londoners and visitors, as we build a better London for all.""

Emma Strain, TfL's Customer Director, said: ""We have been blown away by the response to our call out for more buskers, and there's a palpable feeling of excitement at all the stations where the auditions are taking place as musicians tune up to showcase their talents. In a diverse, multicultural city like London, music truly is a common language. As Londoners pass through our stations and go about their busy lives, it has the power to cheer them on during the good times and lift them up in their lower moments.""

Rachel Meir, CEO of Found in Music, said: ""We're really excited to be part of this world-renowned busking circuit. It's a reminder of the huge range of talent in and around London, and an integral part of the music scene we must cherish and protect. I'm looking forward to seeing many of the new performers playing not only on the Underground circuit, but also in music venues and larger stadiums in years to come. Grassroots music is where is all begins - you never know who's listening, and that's where the magic lies.""

2024-02-29,Feb, TfL changes set to boost the bus network in the Croydon and Sutton area,"Improvements to the bus network in the Croydon and Sutton area will start from Saturday 2 March, following the introduction of more than 80 electric buses in the area last summer

These changes will make it easier for people to travel affordably and sustainably, provide new local connections, and add over more than 500,000 operated bus kilometres per year to the network 
Buses are a vital part of the transport network for millions of Londoners, with the Hopper fare giving people unlimited journeys for £1.75, made within one hour of touching in 
Transport for London (TfL) is bringing in improvements to the bus network in the Croydon and Sutton area from this Saturday 2 March, as work continues to grow outer London's bus network, making it bigger, simpler and more efficient, while improving access to places where people need to travel.

The bus network across London plays a vital role in enabling people to travel affordably and sustainably, with more than 95 per cent of Londoners now living within 400 metres of a bus stop. By focusing on the local bus network, TfL is continuing to support current and expected demand in the areas, providing connections Londoners need, while ensuring resources are fully invested where customer demand is highest. 

The key changes set to be introduced include: 

Bus route 312 will be extended, providing customers with new direct links between Norwood Junction and Purley 
Bus route 434 will be extended from Whyteleafe South to Caterham Station, providing new connections to the town centre and train station. Bus route 434 will follow a temporary routeing via Godstone Road pending road modifications to allow it to use its final new routeing along Higher Drive in Kenley 
A new route 439 will be introduced linking Waddon Marsh, Sainsburys to Whyteleafe South, to make it easier for people to travel between key destinations in the area including schools, stations, hospitals and town centres 
Another new bus route, the S2, will be introduced in Sutton connecting St Helier Station to Epsom, Clock Tower via Sutton Town Centre 
Bus routes 470, S3, S4 and 166 will be re-routed to complement other changes to the network and to enable buses to serve people more effectively, with route 455 being replaced by the new bus changes 
Last summer, TfL introduced more than 80 electric buses in the area and some of the bus changes will result in additional electric buses serving the area.

These enhancements are part of the Mayor's commitment to improve outer London's bus network and follow a comprehensive review of the local bus network. The changes complement other work that TfL is doing to improve and grow outer London's bus network, which includes the Superloop, a network of express routes in outer London connecting town centres, hospitals, schools and transport hubs. The SL7 between West Croydon and Heathrow Central was renumbered and had its frequency doubled from two buses per hour to four buses per hour when it launched in August, leading to around a 70 per cent increase in passenger usage. The SL5 between Croydon and Bromley was also launched in February this year, providing quicker connections between the neighbouring boroughs.

The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said: 

'When I became Mayor I made a promise to Londoners to improve public transport in outer London, and it's a promise I'm proud to have delivered on. The Superloop has already transformed journeys in outer London, with the full loop to be in service by the end of March. We're also working hard to introduce more localised, but just as significant, improvements all over the network, bringing real benefits to the people who rely on buses to get around London.

'I will continue to improve the bus network in outer London and strengthen alternatives to private car use as I build a better, fairer and greener city for all Londoners.'

Geoff Hobbs, TfL's Director of Public Transport Service Planning, said:

 'We aim to always offer affordable and sustainable public transport options where possible, with more than 95 per cent of Londoners living within 400 metres of a bus stop. We know how vital an efficient bus service is for the people in Croydon and Sutton and we constantly monitor and review our bus network to ensure our bus services reflect current and expected customer demands.

'These improvements will play an important role in attracting even more people to the bus network and we think these changes will enable us to serve our customers even more effectively. As always, we will monitor these changes closely to ensure our buses are operating as they should be and encourage customers to check their journeys using the planning tools on our website or the TfL Go app.'",0.33829820427840535,Thu,0.94,1.12,1.01,0.98,0.86,0.89,0.93,0.94,0.85,1.010752688172043,0.9911504424778763,0.9994179278230502,1.0078644888082275,1.0563583815028903,1.0216070222822418,1.0568181818181819,1.0223928342930262,1.0284697508896798,0.9942824471126357,0.9587599051419979,0.9753996737357259,0.9859959211420802,1.0686317006212975,1.0313973857970624,1.0791062328498628,0.9838044308632543,0.9924997869257649
2024-03-01,Mar, Mayor confirms landmark off-peak Fridays trial to start on 8 March,"Makes call to Londoners: #LetsDoFridays
 
 




 ""Encouraging more people back into the city on Fridays could give a much-needed boost to the hospitality, business and leisure sectors, supporting London's wider economic growth as we continue to build a fairer, greener and more prosperous London for everyone""
 
 Sadiq Khan
 The Mayor of London
 


 
Pay as you go with contactless and Oyster fares on Tube and rail across London and parts of the Southeast will be off-peak all day on Fridays from 8 March until 31 May 2024, in an initiative that will be closely watched around the world
Trial will also benefit 60+ and Freedom Pass holders who will be able to use their passes all day on Fridays
Off-peak fares on Fridays seek to help keep London roaring back, support a further return to the office and provide a further boost to the city's economy
Host of offers to be made available during the trial to further allow Londoners and visitors to make the most of all London has to offer
The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has today confirmed that a trial where Tube and rail fares on pay as you go with contactless and Oyster will be off-peak all day on Fridays, will begin next Friday on 8 March.

The Mayor has introduced this trial from next Friday to help TfL and rail operators to better understand if off-peak fares on a Friday could help drive ridership and boost London's wider economic recovery. The three-month trial will run until 31 May and will be keenly watched by major cities looking to bounce back after the pandemic. The trial follows the previous announcement that the Mayor has frozen TfL fares until March 2025, further helping to support Londoners struggling with the cost of living and London's recovery from the pandemic.

Peak pay as you go fares apply between 06:30 and 09:30 and between 16:00 and 19:00 on both TfL and National Rail services. Making pay as you go journeys on Fridays off-peak all day will make it cheaper for people to travel - potentially supporting economic growth by encouraging more people back onto public transport and into the office on a day that is currently quieter than other weekdays.

TfL and the Train companies have now agreed a trial whereby all pay as you go journeys made using contactless and Oyster (with the exception of journeys to/from Heathrow airport via Zone 1) will be off-peak on Fridays. The daily cap will also be amended during the trial to cap at an off-peak rate on Friday, helping those who make multiple journeys through the day save even more. Bus and Tram fares across London will not change during the trial as they are set at a flat rate of £1.75 regardless of the time of travel.

The trial will also see 60+ London Oyster photocard and Older Persons' Freedom Passes allowed to be used on TfL and National Rail services before 9am, helping Londoners with these passes to travel for free all day on Fridays.

To fund the trial, £24m has been allocated from the Mayor of London's recently approved budget, which will be used to compensate TfL and rail operators for lower fares revenue during the trial and cover the costs for running it.

Off-peak Friday fares could give a much-needed boost to London's businesses and commuters at a time when the cost-of-living continues to bite. As an example, someone commuting in from Uxbridge (Zone 6) into Holborn (Zone 1) would currently pay £5.60 for travelling on the Tube. Under this trial, this fare would be reduced to £3.60 - saving them £2.  Someone commuting from Newbury Park (Zone 4) to Canary Wharf (Zone 2) currently pays £2.80 for the trip. This fare would be reduced down to £1.90 - saving them 90p. On National Rail, someone commuting using pay as you go from Epsom to Waterloo would pay £8.80 midweek but will pay £6.10 on a Friday during the trial - saving them £2.70. These savings would be doubled if the return journey was also made during evening peak hours.

The Mayor hopes that having off-peak fares on Fridays could help encourage more people into the city to make the most of London's fantastic offering of bars, restaurants, live music venues and theatres. Those who choose to come into the city on Fridays will also be able to make the most of London's world-leading nightlife, with so many fantastic events and venues to experience this year, as well as the Night Tube and Night Overground running across the weekend.

To further support the trial, TfL and London & Partners, London's business growth and destination agency, has created a new webpage - https://www.visitlondon.com/things-to-do/off-peak-fridays - where Londoners can see a range of offers available on Fridays during the trial. They have also been working with Business Improvement Districts across London, and key stakeholders, to identify a range of deals to further encourage people to make the most of their Fridays.

The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan said:

'I'm doing all I can to support Londoners through the cost-of-living crisis and to support London's economic recovery. This includes freezing TfL fares for another year to make transport more affordable for millions of Londoners and to encourage more people to use our transport network. But I want to do more.

'Encouraging more people back into the city on Fridays could give a much-needed boost to the hospitality, business and leisure sectors, supporting London's wider economic growth as we continue to build a fairer, greener and more prosperous London for everyone. So, I'm making a call to all Londoners: to help London keep roaring back - Let's Do Fridays!'

Shashi Verma, Chief Technology Officer at TfL said:

'While millions of people travel using bus, Tube and rail services across London every day, we are still seeing ridership on Fridays, particularly during peak hours, being lower than other days of the week. This trial of making Fridays off-peak will help us better understand how targeted initiatives like this could help potentially support economic growth by encouraging more people back onto public transport and into the office on a day that is currently quieter than other weekdays.'

Jacqueline Starr, Chief Executive Officer at Rail Delivery Group, said:  

'We want more people to use rail. We're pleased that train companies are able to work with Transport for London to offer this trial to customers and we hope it will encourage more people onto trains in the capital."" 

'We know that people value rail and as seen from our latest research they plan to use it more in the upcoming months.

'It is a greener, more convenient way to travel into and around London. This trial means customers in London can travel at off-peak prices on Fridays by using pay as you go on Oyster or Contactless.'

Rose Wangen-Jones, Destination Managing Director at London & Partners, which runs VisitLondon.com, said: 

'Friday is the perfect day of the week to explore London, from attractions, galleries and museum lates to unmissable food and drink, nightlife, and theatre. We're delighted to be working with leading tourism partners across the city to offer up exclusive Friday discounts.

'Broadening the visitor experience for Londoners and visitors alike is a crucial part of our London 2030 Tourism Vision, so we're very excited to be working with TfL on this initiative.'

Ros Morgan, Chief Executive of Heart of London Business Alliance, said: 

'TfL data shows that footfall on Fridays, particularly in the daytime, is yet to return to pre-pandemic levels. This is why we have been calling for innovative trials, such as this welcome announcement, to attract more people to the West End. It has the potential to provide a huge boost to our businesses, particularly in the hospitality, retail and cultural sectors.'

Ruth Duston, CEO and Founder of Primera, which operates 12 central London Business Improvement Districts, said: 

'London has always been a trailblazing city, and it is fantastic to see that our calls for bold action have been heard. Across the BIDs Primera operates, which span the whole of Zone 1, there is no doubt that Fridays are still noticeably quieter than the rest of the week. We are looking forward to working with our partners and stakeholders across the capital to support this trial and put on exciting activations to entice Londoners and visitors to make the most of the off-peak fares.'

City of London Corporation Policy Chairman, Chris Hayward, said: 

'This is a welcome move for our flagship Destination City programme, which sets out a vision for the Square Mile to become a world-leading leisure destination for UK and global visitors, workers, and residents. The capital has a first-class visitor offer, with unparalleled history, cutting edge arts, and outstanding attractions.

'This agreement could deliver a significant boost for London's pubs, cafes, restaurants, and cultural sector. Slashing travel costs will encourage even more people to enjoy our great capital - and support our businesses - as footfall continues to reach its steady rise back to pre-pandemic levels.'

Nic Durston, Chief Executive, South Bank Employers' Group said:

'It's great to see this initiative being trialled to help encourage Friday footfall into central London. This welcome initiative could provide a huge boost to the wider London economy, especially the hospitality and leisure sectors who've been impacted by reduced commuter numbers - not just during the day, but the post-work evening economy too. We hope we will see positive results from the trial.'

2024-03-01,Mar," TfL launches the Green Link Walk, from Epping Forest to Peckham","TfL is launching the Green Link Walk to respond to London's boom in leisure walking since the pandemic and Londoners' desire for more space dedicated to walking 
 
 




 ""This new walking route is a great way to improve Londoners' health and wellbeing by increasing access to nearly 40 of London's green spaces, helping to build a better city for all Londoners""
 
 Will Norman
 The Walking and Cycling Commissioner
 


 
London's newest walking and wheeling route, the Green Link Walk, has become the eighth route to be included in the Walk London Network
New route spans several London boroughs, linking almost 40 areas of green space and other Walk London routes
Leisure walking provides people with an affordable and easy way to maintain their mental and physical wellbeing, while protecting and improving the environment   
A new 15-mile walking route, the Green Link Walk, has been launched by Transport for London (TfL), the City of London, Southwark, Islington, Hackney and Waltham Forest.  The new route will link more communities with green spaces and help to build on increases in leisure walking seen since the pandemic and to fulfil a mayoral manifesto commitment. TfL and the Mayor aim to make London the most walkable city in the world, and the Green Link Walk was conceived in partnership with a range of different walking and wheeling groups, including Ramblers, London Living Streets, Sustrans and CPRE.

Green Link Walk is the eighth route in the Walk London Network and runs from Epping Forest to Peckham town. It links almost 40 areas of green space, including Walthamstow Marshes, London Fields and Burgess Park, and five other Walk London routes. The new route has been created to increase leisure walking in London, improve Londoners' health and wellbeing, and enhance community access to green space and nature. The Walk London Network is one of the largest walking and wheeling networks of any city in the world and includes the Capital Ring, Green Chain, Jubilee Greenway, Jubilee Walkway, Lea Valley, London Outer Orbital Path, and the Thames Path.

Since the pandemic, London has seen a 10 per cent increase in leisure walking, and according to TfL's Leisure Walking Plan, 57 per cent of Londoners want to see more space in London dedicated to walking. The Green Link will cater to this need, providing Londoners with a new 15-mile route travelling through some of London's best green spaces.

The route has been designed with accessibility in mind and TfL has removed barriers such as bollards to ensure that everyone can access the route. The route also avoids streets without dropped kerbs and bridges with steep ramps and steps. Green Link Walk signs will guide people along streets and paths to green spaces and waterways. Two new rain gardens that help reduce and prevent flooding, will be installed on the route, which will go through two major urban realm transformations planned for Clerkenwell Green.

The route is funded from the Mayor's Green and Healthy Streets Fund, which supports projects that redesign streets to integrate green infrastructure and climate resilience measures, alongside interventions that support active travel, reduce carbon emissions and improve air quality.

The Walking and Cycling Commissioner, Will Norman said:

'We've seen a significant increase in leisure walking since the pandemic, and Londoners have told us they're keen for more space dedicated to walking. With spring just around the corner, this new walking route is a great way to improve Londoners' health and wellbeing by increasing access to nearly 40 of London's green spaces, helping to build a better city for all Londoners.'

Christina Calderato, TfL's Director of Strategy and Policy said: 

'We are delighted to launch the Green Link Walk, London's newest leisure walking and wheeling route, and the eighth route to be included in the Walk London Network. London is already a great city to explore on foot and this new route will encourage Londoners to enjoy more of our beautiful green spaces across the capital. Leisure walking has a vital role to play in the health of everyone living in London and we'll continue to work with our partners to ensure everyone has access to high-quality walking infrastructure.'

National Active Travel Commissioner, Chris Boardman said: 

'Walking is fantastic for both your physical and mental wellbeing - especially if it's done in nature - so it's excellent to see the launch of this new route, which will help residents and tourists get out and explore the greener side of London.

'Opening up more opportunities for walks with friends and family, runs along waterways or wildlife spotting will be vital to improving the nation's health. That's why we're working with councils to get more schemes like the Green Link Walk delivered up and down the country.'

David Harrison, Co-founder of Footways and Vice Chair of Living Streets, said: 

'This Walk has everything: marshes and forest, squares, parks and canals, 12th century churches, quiet Georgian and Victorian terraces, and splendid architecture from the 20th and 21st centuries. Do take a look at the features on the Footways digital map of the route. I am so pleased to see the Walk launched after years working with partners to create it.'

Hana Sutch, CEO & Co-Founder at Go Jauntly, said: 

'The new Green Link trail is a brilliant addition to London and navigates some lesser known hidden gems that more people should enjoy. We're so pleased to be able to host the brand new routes on the Go Jauntly app. You can walk or wheel them in sections or enjoy the whole route in one.'

Des Garrahan, Publicity Officer for Inner London Ramblers, said: 

'It's exciting to see a new walk added to London's strategic routes. Joining the much walked as well as loved routes like the Thames Path, Capital Ring & the London LOOP, the Green Link Walk is a radial route that takes you from Epping to Peckham or even Peckham to Epping depending on your view. I can't wait to start leading walks from it, on it and to it. It's also really encouraging to see tangible results from London's Leisure Walking Plan evident on the ground so quickly.'

Kelly Clark, Sustrans London National Cycle Network lead, said: 

'It's wonderful to welcome London's newest walking and wheeling route.  The Green Link Walk joins an established network of hundreds of miles of interesting and beautiful traffic-free routes for Londoners to explore and enjoy for free - including Walk London routes, 150 miles of National Cycle Network (NCN), and many other great local leisure routes.  We are proud to work with TfL and other partners to deliver the actions in the Leisure Walking Plan. As spring arrives, we can think of nothing better than setting out to adventure from your doorstep on London's newest Great Green Route.'

Michael Shilling, volunteer green routes champion, CPRE London, said: 

'The Green Link Walk champions London's precious green and blue spaces, helping foster a deep connection to nature among residents. Through our Great Green Routes work at CPRE London, we campaign to create new green routes, and encourage more people to use existing routes. We want all Londoners gain the health and wellbeing benefits of walking, wheeling, and just being in nature so we're really excited the Green Link Walk is now being launched. London remains at the forefront of efforts to cultivate a greener, healthier, and more harmonious living environment, setting a global example for urban sustainability.'

TfL published London's first Leisure Walking Plan in 2022 to enhance and expand leisure walking routes and better connect London's communities with green spaces.

The Plan contains 13 actions to improve the Walk London Network including auditing the network, upgrading existing routes to make them more accessible, developing new routes to better connect communities with green spaces, and greater promotion of the vast array of leisure walking opportunities across London.  ",0.2816453528346906,Fri,0.94,1.11,0.99,0.97,0.75,0.85,0.88,0.88,0.79,0.9960264900662251,0.9694323144104804,0.9565217391304346,0.9835234474017744,0.9486166007905138,0.9948792977322604,0.9571719918422841,0.9336870026525199,0.9349112426035504,0.9942824471126357,0.9501995488460873,0.9560848287112561,0.9759347382732835,0.9319462505418292,0.9850424471095539,1.0210897687181497,0.9210084033613446,0.9224409784368874
2024-03-04,Mar, New generation of iBus set to enhance bus travel in London,"New £160m iBus contract signed, replacing system that has been operating for 17 years and introducing new technology
 
 




 ""Improving London's transport network and making public transport more attractive for Londoners is a core aim of the Mayor's and key to his commitment to have 80% of journeys made using public transport by 2040""
 
 Seb Dance
 Deputy Mayor for Transport
 


 
Reliability and accuracy of real-time passenger information set to be enhanced by increased information on disruptions and diversions
Since being introduced in 2007, the iBus system has made the bus network easier to use and boosted reliability
Transport for London (TfL) has today awarded a £160m contract over 10 years for the replacement of the existing Automatic Vehicle Location system (iBus) to INIT, an organisation with a global track record of supporting transport companies in making public transport more attractive, faster, and efficient. As part of the contract, INIT will provide both the replacement of on-board hardware and the back-office services for all buses in the TfL vehicle fleet. The current system, operated by Trapeze, has been in operation across London buses for seventeen years.

The next generation of iBus will provide new service control tools for Bus Operators, and will integrate with the current voice radio system, payments and performance management systems, leading to improved service reliability and information provision for customers.

The new iBus system will also build on the success of the current system, with reliability and accuracy of real-time passenger information set to be enhanced further by including disruption and diversion information both on and off the bus. This will be made available to customers via the bus customer information boards and audio-visual announcements, and on the TfL Go app immediately after disruption affects a bus, allowing customers quick access to up-to-date information in order to make informed decisions on how to get from A to B. The information could include details on the route of the diversion and where the buses re-join their original routes.

Customers will also benefit through improved accuracy of arrival information, especially for the early stops on a route, by using data from journeys taken earlier in the day, better reflecting the impact of recent traffic conditions. The new system will also allow TfL to maintain more reliable information for third party apps used for journey planning. The new technology will also offer safety enhancements through issuing hazard warnings to drivers for tight turns or narrow roads.

The current iBus system provides real-time journey information for customers and has made the bus network easier to use and more accessible for all. It has particularly benefited passengers with hearing or visual impairments, who previously may have had to rely on familiarity of a route or assistance from the bus driver to ensure they didn't miss their stop. The current system also allows TfL to warn customers of planned disruption such as major events, to encourage them to plan their travel in advance. Through a combination of technologies, including GPS, iBus has also helped bus operators pinpoint the exact location of buses at any time which helps bus controllers to regulate the service and prevents customers waiting for a long time for a bus and three coming along at once.

Once implemented, bus operators will benefit from the new generation iBus with the ability to change the iBus equipment themselves. This new model will reduce the amount of time that vehicles are out of service and waiting for a repair to be booked in.    

Since March 2023, TfL has been installing a wave of new bus Countdown boards across every borough in the capital. More than 300 additional signs have been installed to date, boosting the overall number of boards to almost 3000 displays, more than any other UK authority. The signs remain a simple and reliable way of helping Londoners get around by bus. Other improvements to customer information on the bus network include trialling of new display types and content for giving customers enriched information about their journey, and the introduction of TfL Go, that gives customers personalised information relevant to their planned and regular journeys.   

TfL has set out a bold vision for buses in the capital in its Bus Action Plan, which sets out how London's modern bus network will attract more customers and help the capital become net zero by 2030. Buses are already the most used form of public transport in the capital, and TfL - via its Bus Action Plan - is working to create an even more attractive alternative to car use by focusing on the experience for all customers, safety and security, faster journeys, improved connections, and decarbonisation and climate resilience. There are already more than 1,300 zero emission buses out on the city's streets, with plans for the whole fleet to be converted by 2030, subject to Government funding. Converting London's bus fleet to zero-emission by 2030 will save an estimated 5.5m tonnes of carbon.   

Seb Dance, Deputy Mayor for Transport, said: ""Improving London's transport network and making public transport more attractive for Londoners is a core aim of the Mayor's and key to his commitment to have 80% of journeys made using public transport by 2040.

""This next iteration of the iBus technology will make journeys more reliable and give customers more accurate and up-to-date travel information, enabling Londoners to travel with ease, and helping to build a better, greener city for everyone.""

Rebecca Bissell, TfL's Director of Information Technology, said: ""We are very pleased to have awarded the contract for the next generation of iBus to INIT. Since being introduced, the iBus system has transformed our customers' journeys, and particularly helped people with visual or hearing impairments, by making it easier to navigate London. The solutions provided by INIT for the next generation of iBus will help us build on this success as we continue to enhance the safety and reliability of our service through improved real-time information for our operators and customers.""  

Jens Mullak, INIT Limited's Managing Director, said: ""We are very proud to be selected by TfL as the supplier for the next generation of the iBus system. This confirms that our long-term technology strategy has been positively recognised. The new system will have a modular open technology platform that is scalable and accommodates TfL's future development ambitions. We are delighted that TfL joins our existing customer group of more than 1,100 public transport organizations worldwide. Our team is looking forward to working with TfL to deliver a world-class on-bus hardware and back office solution for London.""

Jon Eardley, Managing Director of Transport UK London Bus, formerly Abellio London, said: ""As a TfL operator, we are excited to see the award of this contract and the improvements the new technology will bring to our staff and customers. When it was launched, the current iBus system transformed journeys for customers and operators alike. The next generation of iBus will further enhance real-time information and integrate seamlessly with other business systems to provide a platform for growth in the bus network. The new system will vastly improve our driver's experience of service control to allow them to continue to provide our customers with the very best service with millions of safe, reliable and sustainable journeys across the capital every year.""

Clive Wood, Lead Regional Policy and Campaigns Manager at Guide Dogs, said: ""Having accessible real time information when using the London bus network helps blind and partially sighted people travel independently and with confidence. This is particularly important at times when there is disruption or bus diversions. I know from my own experience that being able to access information to plan my journey and to hear those reassuring announcements on the bus makes all the difference. There are an estimated 217,000 people living with sight loss in London which is expected to increase to 264,000 by 2032 as well as thousands who visit our capital. Having accessible information for the bus network makes all the difference.""

The current iBus system supports over 8,000 buses running around 700 bus routes and serving over 19,000 bus stops across Greater London. The system also supports around 80 bus garages, operated by 8 bus operators, responsible for running and maintaining the bus service schedule, and 42 bus operator service control centres, with workstations with the ability to track buses in real time and contact buses by voice radio.

2024-03-05,Mar," Higher penalty fares on TfL services, to reduce fare evasion and ensure consistency across transport networks","Following the Department for Transport's decision to increase the penalty fare to £100 across National Rail, the Mayor approved an increase to the penalty fare on all TfL services from £80 to £100
 
 




 ""Around 96 per cent of people do pay their fares correctly and it is unfair on these people that a minority of people do not""
 
 Siwan Hayward
 TfL's Director of Security, Policing and Enforcement
 


 
The increased penalty fare is now in force meaning fare evaders are covering more of the cost of enforcement
Fare evasion is a criminal offence and prevents TfL from getting vital income that would benefit all customers
During 2023, TfL prosecuted 19,614 people for fare evasion, an increase of 56 per cent on 2022, and investigated 421 people for habitual fare evasion who made more than 50,000 irregular journeys across the Underground network
Transport for London (TfL) has increased the penalty fare for fare evasion from £80 to £100, reduced to £50 if paid within 21 days, to act as a further deterrent to fare evasion. TfL is committed to tackling fare evasion as revenue from fares is vital for investment in safe, clean and reliable public transport. TfL published new data last month which shows that it prosecuted 19,614 people for fare evasion in 2023, an increase of 56 per cent on 2022.

The increase in penalty fares follows the Department for Transport's decision to increase the penalty fare to £100 across National Rail. This will ensure that there are clear and consistent rules and penalties across the different transport networks in London, and that the penalty fare remains an effective deterrent.  

Fare evasion is a criminal offence and is estimated to cost TfL around £130m - £150m a year, money that could be invested back in the transport network. Around 96 per cent of people do pay the correct fare and TfL strives to ensure that wherever possible fare evaders themselves, not fares or taxpayers, pay the cost of fare evasion. Fare evasion and ticket disputes are also a precursor to approximately half of all reported work-related violence and aggression incidents towards frontline transport workers across the network. TfL does not tolerate any violence, aggression or threatening behaviour towards staff or customers and always seeks the strongest possible action against offenders. 

TfL has a comprehensive programme in place to deter offenders, including more than 450 officers undertaking ticket inspection and revenue enforcement activity across every mode of transport every day. Transport staff also provide insight and information about fare evaders to TfL enforcement and investigations teams to take action. TfL has also improved its ability to investigate and detect the most prolific offenders causing the greatest revenue loss through its irregular travel analysis platform (ITAP). ITAP is a detection system that detects fare evasion and revenue loss from patterns in ticketing and passenger data, identifying people who avoid paying for all or part of their journey. Information generated by ITAP supports a variety of intervention activities that aim to measure and reduce revenue loss and deter people from evading their fares. These activities include targeted email campaigns warning customers that they must pay the correct fare, operational station deployments and a register of regular offenders that ITAP has identified for irregular travel patterns who may be prioritised for further investigation and subsequent prosecution. 

Siwan Hayward, TfL's Director of Security, Policing and Enforcement, said: ""Around 96 per cent of people do pay their fares correctly and it is unfair on these people that a minority of people do not. This increase in the penalty fare will ensure that there are clear and consistent rules across the different transport networks in London, and that our penalty fare remains an effective deterrent. Fare evasion is a criminal offence which robs Londoners of vital investment in a safe, frequent and reliable transport network. It also impacts our customers and our staff, and can make public transport feel unsafe. We work to ensure that wherever possible fare evaders themselves, not fare or tax payers, pay the cost of fare evasion."" 

New data on fare evasion prosecution shows that TfL investigated 421 people for habitual fare evasion during 2023 who made more than 50,000 fraudulent journeys across the London Underground network, defrauding TfL of more than £300,000 in lost fare revenue. Of these cases, 190 have been prosecuted to date and 189 were found guilty, with the remaining cases pending court action. TfL is expanding its capability to prosecute more habitual offenders. Fare evasion is a criminal offence which can result in a criminal record for offenders. This also acts as a deterrent due to its impact on other areas including employment opportunities. 

A recent case investigated by TfL identified a passenger fare evading by using a Contactless Payment Card and failing to validate correctly for their journeys. An investigation into the travel patterns of the passenger identified 193 occasions of fare evasion which totalled unpaid fares of over £1,200. The passenger recently attended court and pleaded guilty to all the offences. TfL also recently identified a passenger fare evading by using a bank card that had insufficient funds to pay the fare. Analysis of the card's usage showed a regular failure to validate on every journey made in over a year. CCTV footage was obtained to assist in locating and detecting the offender. The passenger attended court and again pleaded guilty to all the offences. He has been ordered to pay TfL £1,795.60.

2024-03-06,Mar," Glynn Barton to leave TfL to become Chief Operations Officer of Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole (BCP) Council","Transport London (TfL) has today announced that Glynn Barton, who has been interim Chief Operating Officer since October 2022, will be leaving the organisation at the end of May this year to take up the role of Chief Operations Officer of Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole (BCP) Council. Since December 2023, Glynn has also held the role of the Director of Buses for TfL
 
 




 ""I would like to pay tribute to Glynn Barton, who has done a great job of running our operations on an interim basis and directing the largest bus network in Europe""
 
 Andy Lord
 London's Transport Commissioner
 


 
Glynn has been responsible for ensuring TfL's directly operated and contracted services and operations are planned and managed effectively, to provide a safe, efficient, reliable and high-quality service to customers.

Over 22 years at TfL Glynn has used his Transport Planning and Management background across a range of important operational roles including the 2012 London Olympics and the implementation of high-quality cycling infrastructure across London. He played a pivotal role in TfL's transport plan to support events to mark the Platinum Jubilee, the passing of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II and the coronation of Their Majesties King Charles III and Queen Camilla.

In his new role at Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council, Glynn will oversee all of the council's in-house place-based services. The role covers a wide range of service areas which include Environment, Planning & Destination, Investment & Development, Commercial Operations, Infrastructure and Customer, and Arts & Property. 

TfL announced in December last year that Claire Mann, current Managing Director of South Western Railway, will join Transport for London as permanent Chief Operating Officer. She will join TfL on Wednesday 3 April. Glynn and Claire will conduct a handover of the Chief Operating Officer role, prior to Glynn's departure at the end of May 2024.

Alongside the changes at Chief Operating Officer level, a full recruitment process will now commence to appoint a new Director of Buses and if necessary Claire will announce any interim arrangements once she has taken up her role.  

Andy Lord, London's Transport Commissioner, said: ""I would like to pay tribute to Glynn Barton, who has done a great job of running our operations on an interim basis and directing the largest bus network in Europe. Glynn is an outstanding operational leader with a wealth of experience who has worked to consistently improve TfL over the years. I am hugely grateful for the leadership he has shown. 

""This next move in his successful career is hugely positive and I'm certain that BCP Council will benefit from his experience and his passion for putting customers first.""

Glynn Barton said: ""Across 22 years at TfL I have always worked to put customers at the heart of what we do. It is difficult to leave a role which is as fulfilling as supporting and improving London, but it is the right time for a new challenge. And in Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole I will be working to serve an area in which I grew up and for which I have a great affection. 

""I would like to thank all of the colleagues with whom I've worked across my time at TfL - colleagues who work so hard every day to make London, and the transport network that supports it, the very best it can be.""

2024-03-06,Mar, London’s Cycleway network will have quadrupled since 2016 as a major new Cycleway opens in Southwark,"By the end of March, London's Cycleway network will have quadrupled since 2016, from 90km to more than 360km  
 
 




 ""Our continued work in expanding the Cycleway network throughout the capital unlocks access to cycling for many more thousands of Londoners""
 
 Helen Cansick
 TfL's Head of Healthy Streets Investment
 


 
Cycleway 4, a major route between central London and Greenwich, is now complete, with a new section connecting Rotherhithe, Surrey Quays and Deptford  
In the past twelve months, 20 new Cycleway routes have opened, connecting more than 600,000 Londoners to the cycle network  
A new Santander Cycles day pass launched this week, allowing unlimited journeys under 30 minutes all day from £3, making this one of the most affordable ways to travel in the capital  
Transport for London (TfL) and Southwark Council have completed work on Lower Road in southeast London. This new section of Cycleway 4, the latest to be completed, now enables people to cycle safely all the way from London Bridge to Greenwich. It is a vital part of TfL's commitment to expand the cycle network, making it even safer, easier and more affordable for people to travel around London.

The completion of Cycleway 4 means that TfL and London boroughs will have quadrupled the size of the strategic cycle network from 90km in 2016 to over 360km by the end of this month. The rapid expansion of the network in recent years means that nearly a quarter of Londoners now live within 400m of a high-quality route. The new Cycleways are supporting many more people to cycle, by making it more inclusive and removing barriers that stop some Londoners from cycling, with recent TfL data showing that the number of daily cycle journeys has increased to 1.26 million in 2023, a 20 per cent rise compared to 2019.

TfL has also launched a new day pass for Santander Cycles this week, which allows unlimited journeys under 30 minutes all day from £3 and makes Santander Cycles one of the most affordable ways to travel in the capital. TfL is also on track to add an additional 1,400 new e-bikes to the scheme this summer, more than tripling the number available to hire and further expanding access to cycling.

Since 2016, TfL's work alongside London's boroughs has been crucial to the continued rollout of a number of significant new Cycleways in the capital, as well as extensions to existing Cycleways. Major additions to the network include:   

C4 between Tooley Street and Greenwich  
C9 between Hammersmith and Kew Bridge  
C17 along Rosendale Road in Lambeth  
C24 between Tottenham Hale and Walthamstow  
C38 between Angel and Finsbury Park  
C42 between Ilford and Barking Riverside  
Work to complete the 'missing section' of C1 between Edmonton and White Hart Lane, enabling continuous cycling between the M25 and City of London  
On Lower Road, the new section of Cycleway 4 includes 1.3km of protected two-way cycle lanes, which connects the previously completed sections on Jamaica Road and Evelyn Street. As well as the new Cycleway, a new signalised pedestrian crossing has been installed outside the entrance to Southwark Park, further improving pedestrian safety and accessibility. Cycleway 4 now connects central London and Greenwich, with further connections to Cycleways 10 and 14, and has eight new and 28 upgraded pedestrian crossings along the route in total, along with six Santander Cycles docking stations.  

During the next financial year, TfL will continue to work with London's boroughs to deliver more high-quality cycling schemes with £19.5m of investment already announced. This funding will complete Cycleways between Lea Bridge and Dalston, between Deptford and Deptford Creek and Hammersmith and Kensington Olympia. This funding will also progress design and delivery of Cycleways across Bexley, Harrow, Hounslow, Newham and Redbridge.

Will Norman, London's Walking and Cycling Commissioner, said: ""I'm delighted that work on Cycleway 4 is now complete, meaning people cycling can travel more easily and safely from London Bridge all the way to Greenwich. Its completion also means the Mayor, TfL and London boroughs will hit the milestone of quadrupling the size of the strategic cycle network from 90km in 2016 to over 360km by the end of this month.

""Improving our infrastructure and making cycling as accessible as possible for accessible Londoners lies at the heart of the Mayor's vision for a safer and greener London for everyone.""

Helen Cansick, TfL's Head of Healthy Streets Investment, said: ""Our continued work in expanding the Cycleway network throughout the capital unlocks access to cycling for many more thousands of Londoners. The new section of Cycleway 4 is the final piece of the puzzle connecting London Bridge all the way to Greenwich.

""Since 2016, the size of the cycle network in London has quadrupled. This is testament to the work of the Mayor, TfL and London's boroughs and enables even more people to safely travel around the capital by bike, including those in greater London. We'll continue to work closely with boroughs to connect even more of the capital to our high-quality cycle network.""

Jakub Mamczak, Senior Campaigns Officer at London Cycling Campaign, said: ""London Cycling Campaign has campaigned for Cycleway 4 for decades. We're so happy to see it finally open! Even before the Lower Road gap was closed, you could see thousands of people cycling on it that would never have done so before. A connected and coherent, safe cycle network is the vital next step for our city to take to enable Londoners to embrace cycling as a healthy, clean, sustainable transport mode - already cycle journeys in London match up to a third of all Tube journeys. We're looking forward to the next routes coming from the Mayor, TfL and all boroughs so London can truly become a cycling city.""  

Cllr Kieron Williams, Leader of Southwark Council, said: ""In Southwark we're doing a huge amount of work to make the borough more cycle-friendly. The extension of Cycleway 4 is a crucial piece of the puzzle and helps to make cycling an easier option as we seek to improve air quality and reduce carbon emissions. In addition to our 700 cycle hangars, which provide 4,200 cycle spaces, we're improving walking and cycling routes to schools and hope that together these efforts encourage even more residents to get on two wheels.""

TfL's updated Cycling Action Plan 2, published last year, highlights the fundamental role cycling plays in making a greener, more progressive, modern city. The plan outlines why it is essential to broaden the appeal of cycling to a more diverse range of Londoners to ensure cycling levels continue to increase at pace and that all Londoners benefit from the health and economic benefits of cycling. TfL's research shows that people from under-represented groups are open to taking up cycling, but experience different barriers, and the plan outlines ambitious evidence-led measures to support these groups by addressing these barriers.  

TfL is focusing on providing new and innovating wayfinding solutions including installing on-street signs, producing new TfL cycle maps and collaborating with third-party navigation app providers.

Training will be provided over the course of a year, working with Heart of the City
Places for London has also updated its standard lease to include new clauses on the environment and the London Living Wage
Both initiatives form part of Places for London's aim to be an inclusive and sustainable landlord
Places for London - Transport for London's (TfL) property company - is piloting a new business skills training programme for tenants across its estate as part of its commitment to being a responsible and sustainable landlord, encouraging inclusive growth across its estate and building on the extensive support it provided to its tenants throughout the pandemic.

Working with Heart of the City, the new programme, which will take place over the course of a year, will offer up to 40 of Places for London's tenants the opportunity to undertake responsible business skills training. Tenants participating in the pilot will receive a range of training and support at no cost to themselves.

As one of the capital's largest landowners, Places for London provides a home to hundreds of businesses across the city, including florists, cafés, construction companies and garages. Located in arches, high streets and stations across London, around 95 per cent of the businesses on Places for London's estate are small and medium enterprises (SMEs). SMEs play a key role in London's economy, and its reputation as a place of innovation and excitement. However, it can often be a challenge for them to maximise their potential when implementing best responsible business practices, due to a lack of time, resources and expertise.

The new training includes online learning modules, webinars, insight sessions with experts, responsible business health checks and one-to-one sessions with advisors. There will also be opportunities for each business to meet other like-minded tenants from across Places for London's estate, so they can exchange ideas and learnings as well as potentially collaborate with each other.

As well as learning skills like how to protect mental health and wellbeing within SMEs and understand more about accessibility and inclusion, they will also learn about how they can make a wider impact on their communities too, such as through community investment, volunteering and by learning how to measure their carbon footprint and create a net-zero action plan.

By providing this range of support, Places for London hopes that its tenants will help the capital become a more inclusive and sustainable place, transitioning to net zero carbon, and thrive in their own right. By improving their performance and implementing what they have learnt through the training, it is hoped that the tenants will build on their existing success and continue to play an important role as part of Places for London's wider estate. In addition to this training, Places for London is continuing to examine the ways it can support London's SMEs by examining and developing a social value strategy.

Daniel Lovatt, Director of Asset Management at Places for London, said: 

'We are delighted to be piloting our business skills training programme, working with Heart of the City, which will support our tenants as they strive to become even more sustainable. We strongly believe that it is our role as a landlord to help our tenants succeed and continue to play an integral part of their local communities - when they thrive, we do too.'

Maggie Berry OBE, Director at Heart of the City, said: 

'Heart of the City is thrilled to be supporting Places for London's SME tenants through our Foundations for Responsible Business programme, which will help this cohort of businesses get started and advance on their sustainability journey. Navigating the environmental, social and governance (ESG) landscape can be challenging for smaller enterprises, and we're proud to contribute to Places for London's forward-thinking strategy by providing practical training support to their SME tenants. We're looking forward to seeing the positive transformations these SMEs will implement in their workplaces, improving their product and service delivery while contributing positively to society and being a force for good.'

Sarah Ratcliffe, CEO at Better Buildings Partnership, said: 

'Throughout our work at the Better Buildings Partnership, engaging with occupiers to improve the sustainability performance of commercial buildings has been a consistent theme. It is therefore very encouraging to see Places for London, a founding member of the BBP, building on our Green Lease Toolkit to introduce new clauses into the standard lease for its retail and arches estate. Combining this with a commitment to upskilling, building metering and data sharing provides strong foundations for collaborative relationships that enable London to unlock the shared value of more sustainable buildings.'

Joseph Salama, Owner of Jack's Garage, which is taking part in the programme, said: 

'We're excited to be part of Place for London's responsible business training programme, so that we can learn more about how we can build on the work we're already doing - such as through electric vehicle conversions - to make our business and the capital even more sustainable. As part of the programme, I am also looking forward to meeting other businesses from across the estate to hear more about their experiences and exchange ideas as well.'

The new training for tenants is just one of many initiatives Places for London is implementing to support and improve its existing property estate. Earlier this year, an updated standard lease was launched for businesses across its retail and arch estates, which built on its existing standard lease, so that there is now a stronger focus on environmental performance and the London Living Wage. Places for London worked with its tenants as well as members of the Better Buildings Partnership, which has produced a green lease toolkit for organisations to use, when developing these updates to its standard lease.

Places for London now has a programme to roll out meters across the estate, so that energy use can be more easily monitored. By better monitoring energy use, businesses can - working together with Places for London - support the wider goal to reach net-zero carbon in London, as well as ensure they can better manage energy costs.

Businesses will be asked to share this data with Places for London at regular intervals, so a better understanding of the environmental performance of its estate can be reached and assets can be future-proofed effectively. Places for London will also share the environmental performance data it holds with its tenants and will look to provide useful tips and advice to its tenants, so they can become more sustainable. The updated lease will also see tenants commit to not making any changes or additions to their property that will lead to a lower Energy Performance Certificate Rating.

In order to ensure that those working in the capital are receiving a fair wage, the updated lease now includes a clause relating to the London Living Wage. Places for London expects its tenants as they join the estate or renew their existing leases to make a commitment to paying their staff and suppliers the London Living Wage. This will help tenants to not only retain staff, but improve their reputations as responsible, inclusive and ethical businesses.

 ""Butterfly Conservation welcomes TfL's commitment to restoring biodiversity and enhancing green infrastructure""
 
 Steve Bolton
 Big City Butterflies Project Officer at Butterfly Conservation
 


 
The plan, which fully aligns with TfL's Corporate Environment Plan, published in 2021, sets out how TfL will improve and care for green infrastructure and biodiversity across its estate and networks. It captures in one place, for the first time, its existing relevant targets, legal requirements and policy commitments, while also setting out the strategic actions TfL will take to deliver them. The plan was developed following a wide range of engagement within and outside TfL, including London's boroughs.

London is home to a remarkable variety of plant and animal species. From its lush green parks and gardens to its riverbanks and woodlands, the city provides a wide range of habitats. Green infrastructure and biodiversity - the variety of all living things and their interactions - provide a wide range of important benefits, such as helping the city adapt to climate change and encouraging active travel.

This new plan will ensure TfL meets a range of commitments to further enhance and support green infrastructure and biodiversity across London, including:

Achieving a 10 per cent biodiversity net gain on applicable schemes (i.e. planning system projects and Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects) from February 2024
Delivering a net gain in biodiversity across TfL's estate by 2030, compared to the 2018 biodiversity baseline map
Boosting tree canopy cover across TfL by 10 per cent by 2050, compared with the 2016 baseline
Doubling wildflower verges to 260,000 square metres in 2024, and developing a longer-term plan to continue their introduction across London  
Ensuring 5,000 square metres of Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS), such as rain gardens, are installed on TfL's road network each year
Further reduce the use of pesticides across TfL and eliminate where operationally and financially feasible
As one of London's largest landowners, with more than 2,300 hectares across the capital, almost a third of TfL's land is covered by vegetation. This includes land which intersects two Special Areas of Conservation, six Sites of Special Scientific Interest, eight Local Nature Reserves and 139 Sites of Importance for Nature Conservation. TfL's wide variety of habitats, from woodland to wetland, support more than 1,000 animal species - such as a range of butterfly species and eight different species of bat within a disused railway tunnel at Highgate - as well as almost 700 plant species across London. Many of the species found on or near TfL's estate are legally protected and therefore it is important to protect their habitat.

In 2022, TfL was the first transport provider in the UK to carry out a natural capital account for its estate, to the high standards of the Natural Capital Protocol and the relevant British Standard. The account found that the benefits from TfL's natural capital assets that can be monetised have a current estimated gross asset value of £328m. While this is a significant figure, it is still likely to be an underestimate, and TfL is now planning on a range of biodiversity research and innovation projects to help fill in data gaps and improve future accounts.

Using this information, TfL will be able to make better decisions about how to manage its green infrastructure and increase biodiversity. TfL plans to double the area of wildflower verges alongside the TfL Road Network to 260,000 square metres in 2024. It will also explore potential ways to further increase biodiversity at these sites, which already support 17 different species of butterfly, five of which are London Priority species. TfL is also on track to meet its commitment to deliver an additional 5,000 square metres of Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS), such as rain gardens, on its road network each year. These nature-based solutions not only help support biodiversity but also help reduce the risk of flooding from storms.

Across London, TfL is also meeting its target to increase the overall number of street trees on its estate by one per cent per year between 2016 and 2025. A plan to help strategically increase tree canopy across TfL's estate by 10 per cent by 2050 will be published by March 2025. Tree canopies provide shelter from the sun as well as habitats for birds and wildlife.

The health of soil across London can affect its capacity to hold or drain water, and its ability to support particular habitats. The plan outlines how soil on TfL land will be protected from degradation or contamination, reducing the need for additional resources, such as fertiliser and compost. TfL also plans to eliminate the use of pesticides where operationally and financially feasible, having already reduced highways glyphosate use by 70 per cent in recent years.

TfL plays a key role in not only helping to protect, connect and enhance green and canopy cover across its own estate, but also in assisting in making other green spaces, such as parks and recreation grounds, accessible to the public. Providing sustainable travel access can help reduce social and environmental inequalities, so to inform this work, TfL will be mapping sustainable travel access to London's green spaces in relation to socio-economic factors by the end of 2025. This will help inform future investment decisions and ensure that those walking, cycling or taking public transport have clear and easy access to green spaces across the city.

Lilli Matson, Chief Safety, Health and Environment Officer at Transport for London said: ""As one of London's largest landowners, TfL has an extensive network of green corridors, from tree-lined streets to trackside woodland. Together, these play a crucial role in connecting London's green spaces for wildlife.

""Our new Green Infrastructure and Biodiversity plan forms part of our continuing work in creating a greener, more biodiverse city that is resilient and well adapted to climate change. By lowering the environmental impact of our business and offering a range of sustainable ways to travel across London, we can use our real estate and infrastructure to create a city that allows people and wildlife to flourish.""

Steve Bolton, Big City Butterflies Project Officer at Butterfly Conservation, said: ""Butterfly Conservation welcomes TfL's commitment to restoring biodiversity and enhancing green infrastructure. We have supported the expansion of the wildflower verges trail engaging local volunteers in butterfly recording and advising on planting schemes to support butterflies and moths. Improving biodiversity data, habitat quality and connectivity will help support the recovery of butterflies and moths so they can thrive in the urban environment and be enjoyed by everyone.""

Becky Garden, Partnership Officer at Greenspace Information for Greater London (GiGL), said: ""GiGL's contribution to TfL's Green Infrastructure and Biodiversity Plan, through their provision of robust environmental data, visualisations, and modelling, has allowed for an informed approach towards improving and protecting the environment. By providing comprehensive data insights into biodiversity and London's outdoor spaces, GiGL has enabled TfL to foster a plan that will benefit the well-being of people and nature alike. The collaborative efforts between TfL and GiGL facilitates the flow of data across London, from the collection, to use in informing decisions, as it has for the many years TfL has been partnered with GiGL.""

The publication of TfL's Green Infrastructure and Biodiversity Plan is just part of TfL's wider work to drive sustainability across London and become the strong green heartbeat of London. TfL is investing in further decarbonising its operations, including transitioning its support vehicles and buses. It remains on track to have a fully zero-emission bus fleet by 2034, and with Government funding, this could be accelerated to 2030, which would catapult the potential for new production models and help transform the bus industry in the UK.

TfL is working to remove fossil fuels across its building estate, as well as developing wider projects to improve energy efficiency and identify opportunities to generate renewable energy across its estate. Work to procure Power Purchase Agreements as part of its wider ambition to use 100 per cent renewable source electricity across TfL's operations by 2030 is ongoing.

Across London, TfL is also converting lighting within stations, bus shelters and on trains to LED lighting, which uses up to 60 per cent less energy than traditional lighting while providing around 10 per cent brighter light. Currently, more than a third of Tube stations across London have been converted to LED lighting, and TfL expects to have all bus shelters, including those used in advertising panels, converted to LED lighting shortly.

2024-03-08,Mar, TfL marks International Women’s Day with a range of events to encourage more women to join transport and engineering sectors,"A range of activities supported by TfL this International Women's Day encourages more women to join these exciting sectors
 
 




 ""This International Women's Day, we want to show that Transport for London offers women varied and rewarding career opportunities, and we hope that our efforts to do this will help women to see that every role at TfL is open to them""
 
 Patricia Obinna
 TfL's Director of Diversity and Inclusion
 


 
Six new internship placements for women will be introduced this summer as part of TfL's new Women in Bus and Coach initiative, and TfL's Women into Transportation and Engineering pre-employment programme (WiTnE) will offer up to 20 women the opportunity to experience working within transport and engineering later this year
TfL's Women's Staff Network host a series of talks this March celebrating the role of women at TfL, and women's achievements are celebrated through TfL's Engineering Icons Tube map and recognised in the re-naming of London Overground lines
This International Women's Day, Friday 8 March, Transport for London (TfL) is encouraging women to consider joining the transport sector and engineering roles through a number of events and activities.

While progress has been made to encourage more women into these sectors, TfL is working hard to continue making the industries more inclusive and representative, particularly in operational roles.

TfL is actively working to improve representation at all levels within its business through a range of different interventions. These include providing and promoting initiatives that encourage women to enter the transport sector, as well as addressing any barriers that prevent women from advancing to senior and higher-paying positions, particularly in operational areas.

Today, TfL is hosting the final of its schools challenge, Innovate, which has seen students design an innovation that could help TfL deliver on its vision of being a strong green heartbeat for London. The winning innovation will be announced at today's ceremony and will include a panel discussion hosted by senior women leaders from TfL and the engineering sector to mark International Women's Day. They will discuss their experiences of working in transport, to inspire more young people and particularly girls to consider careers in transport and engineering.

The London Transport Museum is hosting a Museum Late: Women on the Move today, which will spotlight the jobs women do to keep London moving, the journeys they have taken to get there, and will explore women's diverse experiences of travelling and working in the capital.

TfL's efforts to encourage more women to consider careers in transport and engineering are ongoing and throughout March, TfL's internal Women's Colleague Network Group is hosting several events to encourage more women to seek new opportunities in more male-dominated areas such as engineering and technology.

Last year, TfL launched the 'Women in Bus and Coach' initiative to help share expertise and develop solutions to ensure a career in the bus and coach industry is attractive to women of all ages, backgrounds and ethnicities. Several commitments to encourage women to join transport and engineering are in progress and the network will launch six new internship places specifically for women, this summer.

TfL's supplier skills team have also been actively working with suppliers to increase the number of women working in transportation, engineering and construction sectors. Later this year up to 20 women will be given the opportunity to experience working within these sectors through TfL's support of a Women into Transportation and Engineering pre-employment programme (WiTnE).

TfL is also actively supporting women's progression into senior management roles by launching a new 'Getting ready for Senior Leadership' programme designed to help better prepare internal colleagues for a move into senior leadership.

Deputy Mayor for Transport, Seb Dance, said: ""The Mayor and TfL are committed to diversifying and strengthening TfL's workforce and are working hard to attract more women to the transport and engineering sectors.

""This year TfL is marking International Women's Day with a number of events and activities, which we hope will encourage more women into these exciting and vital industries.""

Patricia Obinna, TfL's Director of Diversity and Inclusion, said: ""This International Women's Day, we want to show that Transport for London offers women varied and rewarding career opportunities, and we hope that our efforts to do this will help women to see that every role at TfL is open to them.""

Lina Shari who joined TfL's WiTnE programme, says: ""I hadn't considered transport as a career option but, following the programme, I'm now have a role as a Workflow Coordinator at Kier. The fact that the programme is specifically made to benefit women, and help them with their career path was key for me. This experience opened my eyes and made me aware of what happens on London roads every day.""

Last November, TfL, the Royal Academy of Engineering and the London Transport Museum created a reimagined version of London's iconic Tube map, honouring the contributions of engineers in London, the UK and worldwide. The Engineering Icons Tube map celebrates the achievements of many female engineers and was created to help encourage more people to consider engineering as a career.

The engineering profession in the UK is experiencing a concerning skills and diversity shortfall. Research shows that almost half (47 per cent) of UK pupils aged 11-19 have not considered engineering as a potential career [1]. According to the latest available data, only 16.5 per cent of the UK engineering workforce is made up of women, and Black and minority ethnic groups represent only around 11.4 per cent [2].

Later this year, two of London's six Overground lines will be renamed to recognise the historic contribution women have made to London. The Suffragette line will celebrate how the working-class movement in the East End fought for women's rights. The line runs to Barking, home of the longest surviving Suffragette Annie Huggett, who died at 103.

The Lioness line, which runs through Wembley, will honour the historic achievements and lasting legacy created by the England women's national football team that continues to inspire the next generation of women and girls in sport.",0.25824277865432016,Fri,0.96,1.13,1.02,1,0.76,0.87,0.92,1,0.9,1.0172185430463576,0.9868995633187772,0.9855072463768115,1.0139416983523448,0.9612648221343874,1.0182882223847842,1.0006798096532972,1.0610079575596818,1.0650887573964498,1.0154373927958833,0.9673202614379085,0.9850570962479608,1.0061182868796736,0.9443722005490536,1.008219916453308,1.0675029400235203,1.0466004583651642,1.0508821273331628
2024-03-11,Mar, Plan ahead for part closures of the Northern line starting next month to facilitate the major upgrade of Colindale Tube station ,"Part closures of the Northern line between Golders Green and Edgware in spring and summer 2024 will facilitate the major upgrade of Colindale Tube station
 
 




 ""I'd like to thank our customers in advance for their patience during these part closures of the Northern line which we appreciate will cause some disruption to people's journeys""
 
 Stuart Harvey
 TfL's Chief Capital Officer
 


 
First part closure will take place from 2 to 11 April 2024, with others over weekends in June and July  
 Track closures are necessary due to the proximity of some of the construction work to upgrade Colindale station to the track, meaning it cannot be safely carried out when trains are running  
Detailed travel advice for customers affected by these closures is available at TfL travel advice - Colindale  
Transport for London (TfL) is reminding customers that the first in a series of part closures of the Northern line between Golders Green and Edgware, to facilitate the major upgrade of Colindale Tube station, is next month.  

The first planned track closure will take place from Tuesday 2 to Thursday 11 April 2024. There will also be closures of the same section of the line over weekends in June and July this year.  

During these closures, there will be no Tube service to or from Brent Cross, Hendon Central, Colindale, Burnt Oak or Edgware Underground stations. Northern line trains will continue to run as normal to and from Golders Green, with a regular service on the rest of the Northern line. Rail replacement bus services will run between Golders Green and Edgware stations, and also to Canons Park station for Jubilee line services, during the track closure periods. Detailed travel advice, including alternative routes, for customers affected by these closures is available on TfL's website at TfL travel advice - Colindale.  

The part closures are linked to the major upgrade of Colindale Tube station which includes building a larger ticket hall and installing a lift to give the station step-free access for the first time. The station's major upgrade will mean it has to close from Friday 7 June until December 2024.   

The associated part closures of the Northern line are necessary due to the proximity to the track of some of the construction work to upgrade Colindale station - including piling, crane operation and demolition work - meaning it cannot be safely carried out when trains are running. During these closures, TfL will also take the opportunity to carry out additional track maintenance and engineering works which will help improve overall services along this section of the Northern line, offering a more reliable and comfortable service for customers.  

Stuart Harvey, TfL's Chief Capital Officer, said: ""I'd like to thank our customers in advance for their patience during these part closures of the Northern line which we appreciate will cause some disruption to people's journeys. They are essential in order to facilitate the complex work being carried out as part of the major upgrade of Colindale station. We are committed to doing everything we can to ensure that, through our detailed travel advice, customers can plan ahead and are able to complete their journeys using the public transport network.""  

The additional part closures of the Northern line between Golders Green and Edgware will take place on the following weekends:  

o   Saturday 8 - Sunday 9 June   

o   Saturday 15 - Sunday 16 June   

o   Saturday 29 - Sunday 30 June   

o   Saturday 27 - Sunday 28 July   

TfL has launched a widescale communications campaign ahead of the track closures and the temporary closure of Colindale station which includes targeted customer emails, posters and PA announcements at stations. TfL's Journey Planner and TfL Go will also be updated with the latest travel information. TfL is encouraging customers to use these real-time travel tools to plan ahead during these essential closures.

2024-03-12,Mar, Harrow transport worker showcases art-inspired poetry at central London Tube station,"Harrow station customer service manager and writer Anthony Okolie showcases poetry for thousands to see at St James's Park station
 
 




 ""Not only do our TfL workforce deliver a brilliant transport service, they have a host of remarkable talents and I can't wait to see and read these poems on the Underground as we build a better London for everyone""
 
 Justine Simons OBE
 Deputy Mayor for Culture and the Creative Industries
 


 
Okolie is the second member of TfL staff to develop their literary talent with Art on the Underground programme
Literary works take inspiration from Art on the Underground's exciting programme, including the annual mural at Brixton Underground station
Full set of Poems on the Underground works, spanning almost 40 years, is now part of the Cambridge University Library archive
Poems exploring the theme of love in all its guises are now on Tubes and trains across the network
A poem by a creative transport worker from Harrow-on-the-Hill about a mural at Brixton station is now displayed at St James's Park station for the next year, as part of TfL's Art on the Underground's writer in residence scheme.

Talented Anthony Okolie's poem 'Ode to the Mother' is inspired by the large-scale public artwork by Jem Perucchini over the entrance of Brixton Underground station. 'Rebirth of a Nation,' responds to the diverse narratives of the area and in recognition of the local murals painted in Brixton in the 1980s. The bright and reverent mural draws from the Ivory Bangle Lady, the name given to the North African occupant of an ancient grave dated to around the 4th century, which Okolie says ""conjured the notion of the strong women and mothers often taken for granted and seldom acknowledged as much as they could be.""

'Ode to the Mother' has launched as an artwork poster on the platform of St James's Park station, and is on view for a year, with the 45-line poem arranged across four panels.

Anthony has worked for TfL for six years as a Customer Service Manager at Harrow-on-the-Hill station. As a creative writer and filmmaker in his spare time, he is inspired by history, psychology and the so-called 'mundane' aspects of everyday life, portraying authenticity and realism in his work and highlighting the different perspectives of people going through similar, if not the same, routines and emotions. By day, Anthony helps with the smooth and safe daily operation of the busy interchange in northwest London, helping people get to where they need to be on the Metropolitan line.

Art on the Underground's Writer in Residence scheme was established in 2022 to highlight and amplify the creative voices within TfL, creating engaging responses to art across the network.

Deputy Mayor for Culture and the Creative Industries, Justine Simons OBE, said:

'Anthony Okolie's poetry celebrating the strength of women and mothers will be a delightful new addition to London's transport network.

'Not only do our TfL workforce deliver a brilliant transport service, they have a host of remarkable talents and I can't wait to see and read these poems on the underground as we build a better London for everyone.'

Eleanor Pinfield, TfL's Head of Art on the Underground, said: 

'TfL's diverse workforce is full of untapped talent and it's been fantastic to see our resident writers showcase their writing skills alongside their operational roles. The range of works exhibited with our Art on the Underground programme provides rich inspiration for writing about important themes such as gender equality, while St James's Park Tube station is the perfect place for Okolie's work to be seen by thousands of Londoners and visitors to the capital.'

Art on the Underground Writer in residence, Anthony Okolie, said: 

'To have this great honour bestowed upon me by Art on the Underground was a truly humbling experience and I'm eternally thankful. I felt the weight of responsibility to carry on from the exceptional writings of the inaugural resident writer, Ayesha Kundi. I hope my poem can resonate with and perhaps intrigue whoever gets the opportunity to read it. I also hope others are inspired, as much as I was, to share their creativity in the upcoming open call for Writer in Residence next year.'

Okolie's first piece to be displayed with Art on the Underground was 'DESCEND and DISSENT', written in response to the 2023 Art on the Underground performance by with artist Barby Asante last year.

The first writer in residence was Customer Service Assistant Ayesha Kundi, who gave a spoken word performance at partner Uniqlo's flagship London store earlier this month. Her poem 'Stooped in Courage,' which was previously displayed at St James's Park station, was inspired by artist Rhea Storr's 'Uncommon Observations: The Ground that Moves Us' at Heathrow T4, Notting Hill Gate, Bethnal Green and Stratford Underground stations, and artist Shanti Panchal's mural 'Endurance' at Brixton Underground station.

Entries and exits at St James's Park have increased since the pandemic, reaching a peak of almost 250,000 on Sunday 23 April last year, the day of the London Marathon. [1]

TfL is championing poetry in other areas of its operations, and the publication of 'DESCEND and DISSENT' at St James's Park station comes as Cambridge University Library acquires the full Poems on the Underground archive, to supplement the university's growing archive and manuscript holdings relating to contemporary poetry. Poems from the collection are also part of the holdings at the London Transport Museum and the Poetry Library at the Southbank Centre in Waterloo, London.

Within the archive, London has provided inspiration for several of the poets whose work has featured on transport network, with 51 poems referencing the capital. In his 2001 poem 'The London Breed', the late Benjamin Zephaniah describes the diversity of the capital: 'The music of the world is here, Dis city can play any song, They came to here from everywhere, Tis they that made dis city strong.'

A new set of poems, the first to appear on trains this year, have been introduced. The poems explore themes of love - of persons and places, welcomed, scorned, remembered, rediscovered - reflecting the diversity of human experience. Works of classic authors Byron and Brontë sit alongside more contemporary poems from Seni Seneviratne and Marjorie Lofti.",0.26518000433571914,Tue,0.92,1.14,1.03,0.97,0.83,0.86,0.92,1,0.9,0.9748344370860927,0.9956331877729256,0.9951690821256037,0.9835234474017744,1.049802371541502,1.0065837600585223,1.0006798096532972,1.0610079575596818,1.0650887573964498,0.9731275014293883,0.9758806177338192,0.9947145187601958,0.9759347382732835,1.0313538505996243,0.9966311817814311,1.0675029400235203,1.0466004583651642,1.0508821273331628
2024-03-12,Mar," London’s pioneering new network of express bus services, the Superloop, now circles the entire capital","The final three services in the first ever 'loop' of TfL's new network of express bus services are now in operation
 
 




 ""We're determined to make transport better for everyone and these final two orbital services in the Superloop network will make it even easier to get around northeast, east and southeast London""
 
 Glynn Barton
 TfL's Chief Operating Officer
 


 
The 138km loop connects key locations across outer London and is part of the Mayor's commitment to improving the outer London bus network 
Superloop services have added more than six million bus kilometres to the capital's network - with demand in the initial routes 15 per cent higher than the network average
The new SL2 is an express service between Walthamstow Central and North Woolwich, while the new SL3 service operates an express service between Thamesmead and Bromley North and the SL5 operates an express service between Bromley North and Croydon Town Centre  
Transport for London (TfL), the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, and bus operators Arriva and Stagecoach have launched three new services in the capital's game-changing network of express bus services, the Superloop. The launch of the SL2, SL3 and SL5 this year means that the Superloop network now circles the entire capital, connecting communities across outer London and giving Londoners even better access to affordable and sustainable travel. The bus network plays a vital role in the capital and Superloop is part of the Mayor's commitment to improving it for everyone.

The 138km loop now connects town centres, hospitals, schools and transport hubs and other key locations across outer London, from Arnos Grove in the north to Woolwich in the east, Croydon in the south and Hayes in the west. Services have been designed to offer quicker journey times between key outer London destinations. Route SL5 has reduced the journey time between East Croydon and Bromley South by around 35 per cent (during weekday off-peak hours). Distinctive branding has been added to buses and to stops on the new network to ensure that the services are easily recognisable for Londoners.

The new SL2 route runs between Walthamstow Central and North Woolwich, connecting to Tube and rail services at Gants Hill, Ilford and Barking. The new SL3 route is now running via Abbey Wood Station, Bexleyheath Station, Sidcup Station, Queen Mary's Hospital and Chislehurst Station, calling at 15 stops in each direction. The SL5 route runs an express service between Bromley and Croydon, via Bromley North Station, Bromley South Station, Bethlem Royal Hospital and East Croydon Station, calling at 11 stops in each direction. All services run every 12 minutes Monday to Saturday day times and every 15 minutes during all other day service times.

TfL data has already shown that Superloop services are popular with the public. Early ridership data shows the successes of the network - with demand growth in the initial routes 15 per cent higher than the network average. In total, the new Superloop services have added more than six million bus kilometres to the capital's network, more than the four million originally forecast. The network now connects people using it with 310 other bus routes, 49 rail stations and 23 different rail lines and early ridership figures show than almost half of all Superloop journeys involve an interchange with another mode of public transport, showing the important role it is already playing in outer London's connectivity. The final route in the new network, the SL4, will begin operating between Canary Wharf and Grove Park once Silvertown Tunnel opens in 2025.

More than 95 per cent of Londoners now live within 400 metres of a bus stop. In addition to the Superloop, TfL continues to work alongside London's boroughs to improve the bus network. Alongside the daily cap, the Mayor's Hopper Fare means customers can take unlimited journeys within an hour for just £1.75, meaning customers can save money on multi-route journeys, encouraging Londoners to travel more sustainably.

Beyond the Superloop, the Mayor and TfL are committed to enhancing the bus network across outer London. These more localised changes - like the recent changes in Sutton and Croydon, which added over 500,000 kilometres to the network - are no less significant than the Superloop and make the bus network, bigger, easier and more efficient, while improving access to places where people need to travel.

The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said: ""I'm thrilled that the full loop of the Superloop is complete, following the launch of three routes this year, the SL2, SL3 and SL5, meaning that services circle the entire city.

""The Superloop is a game-changing new network of express buses that have added more than six million additional bus kilometres to the capital's bus network, linking stations, town centres, hospitals and transport hubs. I'm so excited about the benefits these new services will bring by providing Londoners with stronger alternatives to private car use, and helping us to build a better, greener London for everyone.

""When I made the tough decision to expand the ULEZ London-wide, one of my key commitments to Londoners was to improve transport links in outer London. Today I'm proud to say I'm delivering on this commitment.""

Glynn Barton, TfL's Chief Operating Officer, said: ""We're determined to make transport better for everyone and these final two orbital services in the Superloop network will make it even easier to get around northeast, east and southeast London. The Superloop was made with customers in mind, giving them quicker and more sustainable options when it comes to public transport in outer London. It's great to see people using our services across the new network and we'll continue to work closely with every borough to make the bus network even better.""

Cllr Cameron Geddes, London Borough of Barking and Dagenham's Cabinet Member for Regeneration and Economic Development, said: ""As Barking and Dagenham continues to grow it's great that by working with TfL we're able to improve transport infrastructure for our community by providing things like the Superloop.

""Barking and Dagenham has some of the best transport options for its residents in London, and with the new Superloop bus route, travelling around B&D and the capital has never been easier.""

James Asser, Deputy Mayor and Cabinet Member for Environment and Sustainable Transport, at Newham Council, said: ""We are dedicated to improving public transport in Newham. An increase in north-south connections on eastern side of Newham is something we have been looking to improve and the new SL2 Superloop route will help meet that need. Newham is a growing borough and the Superloop will help increase public transport capacity in an area with a fast growing population and is a welcome addition to bus services in the borough."" 

Cllr Vicky Ashworth, Lead Member for Jobs, Social Cohesion and Equalities at Waltham Forest council, said: ""I am delighted to welcome the new Superloop, SL2 route operating between Walthamstow Central and North Woolwich, connecting to Tube and rail services at Gants Hill, Ilford and Barking. The service supports our local infrastructure by providing convenient and expanded access to shops, businesses and jobs, connecting our town centres, schools, hospitals, transport hubs - opening up avenues for expanded employment opportunities for the people of Waltham Forest. As the leading car free borough we welcome this new service and provision of alternative transport options for Waltham Forest.""",0.34310999095226197,Tue,0.92,1.14,1.03,0.97,0.83,0.86,0.92,1,0.9,0.9748344370860927,0.9956331877729256,0.9951690821256037,0.9835234474017744,1.049802371541502,1.0065837600585223,1.0006798096532972,1.0610079575596818,1.0650887573964498,0.9731275014293883,0.9758806177338192,0.9947145187601958,0.9759347382732835,1.0313538505996243,0.9966311817814311,1.0675029400235203,1.0466004583651642,1.0508821273331628

Transport for London (TfL) is advising customers about how to become an active bystander if they witness a crime, harassment or incidents of anti-social behaviour across London's transport network, as the world marks International Bystander Awareness Day.

Figures from London TravelWatch* show that 63 per cent of people using public transport in London would feel more confident intervening in an incident if they had more information on how to help. There has been a rise in hate crimes across the UK, particularly antisemitic and Islamophobic incidents, and being an active bystander can prevent or de-escalate incidents. This can also be beneficial with other incidents such as sexual harassment, where intervening safely can made a big difference. 

TfL is encouraging customers to take a stand, with three simple ways to diffuse a situation and support their fellow travellers, but only if they feel safe to do so:

Distract the perpetrator by asking the person being targeted an unrelated question, such as, ""do you have the time?"" or ""what's the next stop?""
Make note of what has happened and any information about the offender. Report these details to the British Transport Police on 61016 or by using the Railway Guardian App on TfL's Underground and rail networks. Or if on a bus call the Metropolitan police on 101 or by going online at met.police.uk. In an emergency, always dial 999
Make sure the victim is okay
The annual National Bystander Awareness Day began in 2019, run by charity Communities Inc, to unite people against hate and hostility and in January 2023 the event expanded internationally.

London's Deputy Mayor for Transport, Seb Dance, said: ""The Mayor and I want everyone to be able to use public transport without fear of abuse and TfL takes a zero-tolerance approach to hate crime. Today, I'm asking Londoners to join us in sending the message that hate has no place in our city.

""Londoners have told us that they want to be able to intervene safely if they witness a hate crime, and they would feel more confident doing so if they had information on the best and safest ways to help. That is why TfL is engaging with Londoners on how to be an active bystander against hate crime and violence against women and girls to build a better, safer London for everyone.""

Siwan Hayward, TfL's Director of Security, Policing and Enforcement, said: ""Everyone should be and feel safe when using public transport and making this a reality is our top priority. On International Bystander Awareness Day we are supporting Londoners who want to be active bystanders, to help de-escalate incidents and support each other.""

In late 2023, TfL funded a series of eight sessions by charity Protection Approaches to empower people to take action to prevent or reduce harm when they encounter hate crime, looking at how to respond to a series of hypothetical scenarios. The charity will organise follow-up sessions with everyone who attended the training sessions later this spring to better understand how it has improved their confidence to respond to hate crime.

Andy Fearn, Co-Executive Director at Protection Approaches, said: ""Whether it is an inappropriate comment in the workplace, harassment on the Tube, or a physical assault in the street, we know that Londoners want to stand up when they witness hate and to do all they can to help protect the victims. Yet most don't act because they're unsure how to do so safely and in a way that will ensure the best outcomes. That is why our Active Bystander training has been so important. Our training is proven to helping people feel more confident and equipped to act in the face of hate and discrimination.""

The safety of customers is TfL's top priority and measures are in place to keep Londoners safe as they travel across the city. Thousands of frontline staff are trained to support customers, with more than 500 TfL enforcement officers and around 2,000 police and police community support officers policing the network. TfL has an extensive CCTV network and 24/7 control rooms that monitor the network and provide support in emergencies. Body-worn video cameras, which capture audio recordings as well as images, are used by all TfL frontline customer facing staff.

TfL recently launched Equity in Motion, a plan with more than 80 actions to make London transport fairer, more accessible and more inclusive. This includes outreach activity being expanded to support rough sleepers in London, and Project Guardian school sessions, run by the London Transport Museum, on sexual harassment reaching a further 22,000 Year 9 students in 2024 compared to 2023.

By 2026, focussed research and engagement will look to better understand the experiences of disabled customers, women and girls, and LGBTQ+ people and their concerns about safety and security, and in the following year, frontline staff will be provided with training, guidance and tools to support victims of sexual violence and harassment, and hate crime.",0.3200338810086088,Wed,0.93,1.14,1.05,0.98,0.81,0.86,0.9,0.93,0.84,0.985430463576159,0.9956331877729256,1.0144927536231882,0.9936628643852978,1.024505928853755,1.0065837600585223,0.9789259007477906,0.9867374005305041,0.9940828402366864,0.9837049742710121,0.9758806177338192,1.0140293637846656,0.9859959211420802,1.0065019505851756,0.9966311817814311,1.044296354370835,0.9733384262796029,0.9808233188442853
2024-03-18,Mar, Transport for London to push ahead with green heating and energy efficiency in head offices and depots,"Transport for London will install solar panels, LED lighting and heat pumps, which will reduce reliance on gas powered heating

These upgrades were made possible by the Public Sector Decarbonisation Scheme, which is funded by Department of Energy Security and Net Zero and administered by teams at Salix
Transport for London is continuing to work to reduce carbon emissions and reliance of fossil fuels across its estate
Transport for London (TfL) has been awarded two grants totalling more than £16m from the Public Sector Decarbonisation Scheme (PSDS), which is delivered by Salix on behalf of the Department of Energy Security and Net Zero. A grant worth £14m will be used to reduce carbon emissions at six sites on TfL's London-wide estate. The second grant, worth more than £2m, will be used for carbon reducing measures at two London Underground depots. The successful grant applications were supported by the Mayor's Retrofit Accelerator for Workplaces programme.

This welcome new substantial funding will be used to bring in carbon reducing infrastructure such as heat pumps, solar panels, LED lighting, improved glazing and wall insulation. Six head office buildings across TfL's estate are due to be improved. This work will allow TfL to move away from reliance on fossil fuels that produce harmful carbon emissions and help get closer to achieving TfL and the Mayor's goal of making London a net zero city by 2030.

Currently gas use at Palestra, TfL's head office in Southwark, represents 45 per cent of all TfL head office gas use and 22 per cent of TfL's office carbon emissions, however once the work funded by the grant is completed, both will be reduced to zero. TfL forecasts that the Salix grant will bring about a reduction of emissions by 1,732 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e) a year.

TfL has also been awarded £2.3m of grant funding to decarbonise buildings at both Neasden Depot and Finchley Central Signals Depot for London Underground. These projects will target the replacement of ageing fossil fuelled heating systems with low carbon alternatives as well as improving building performance through implementation of fabric measures. Upon completion, these buildings will be better insulated, more comfortable places to work, with modern, low carbon systems such as heat pumps, LED lighting and solar panels. It is anticipated this project will reduce emissions by 300 tCO2e a year.

Last year, the PSDS awarded £592,000 to TfL for work to make the London Trams depot at Therapia Lane TfL's first of a number of low carbon depots- making it cleaner, greener and cheaper to run.

The Therapia Lane project will upgrade heating systems with a mixture of efficient heat pumps and infrared panel heaters that will replace inefficient fossil fuel gas boilers. The additional electricity consumption from the new heating system is planned to be offset by using 1,800m2 of south-facing roof space for solar panels, as well as other energy efficiency measures such as improved insulation and LED lighting. This new heating and power system is forecast to reduce carbon emissions by 148 tCO2e a year.

Lilli Matson, TfL's Chief Safety, Health and Environment Officer, said: ""We are very pleased to have received this grant from Government, which will help us go faster in our plans to decarbonise our estate. By bringing forward plans to get us closer to the Mayor's 2030 net zero target, we are getting ever closer to our vision of being a strong, green heartbeat for London.

""As London's main public transport provider, we have a vital role to play, making our organisation and network ready to respond to the climate emergency and taking action to reduce harmful pollution in our city. We are committed to helping London thrive and become a sustainable city.""

Salix Director of Programme, Ian Rodger said: ""We must move faster if we are to address the challenges around net zero. This is why we are looking forward to working with TfL on delivering their Public Sector Decarbonisation Scheme projects.

""At Salix we are committed to addressing climate change and cannot wait to work alongside TfL with these projects which will have a big impact on their carbon emissions.""

As London's largest landowner and user of electricity, TfL is already using a varied range of resources to reduce its carbon impact and improve green ways of working, including seeking ways to remove fossil fuels across its building estate. TfL is also developing wider projects to improve energy efficiency and identify opportunities to generate renewable energy across its estate. Work to procure Power Purchase Agreements as part of its wider ambition to use 100 per cent renewable source electricity across TfL's operations by 2030 is ongoing.

Katherine Etheridge, ICE Regional Director London, South East and East of England, said: ""Decarbonising infrastructure systems, like transport, are an essential part of meeting the UK's net zero target. The Institution of Civil Engineers sees decarbonisation as not just a technical challenge or environmental issue for civil and infrastructure engineers, but as intrinsic to the thinking behind, design of, and execution of projects. It's great to see a leading organisation like Transport for London prioritising decarbonising its estate, and we look forward to seeing the impact of this, and similar, work."" 

The TfL Corporate Environment Plan, launched in 2021, explains how TfL will help make London a carbon neutral city by 2030 and achieve the environmental outcomes of the Mayor's Transport Strategy. TfL is delivering measures to clean London's toxic air such as the London-wide Ultra Low Emission Zone, the growing numbers of greener buses and zero emission capable taxis.

TfL's wholly owned property company, Places for London, is committed to being a responsible and sustainable landlord and as part of this, launched an updated standard lease for businesses across its retail and arches estate earlier this year, so that there is now a stronger focus on environmental performance. It has a programme to roll out meters across the estate, so that energy use can be more easily monitored. By better monitoring energy use, businesses can - working together with Places for London - support the wider goal to reach net-zero carbon in London, as well as ensure they can better manage energy costs.

Businesses will be asked to share energy data with Places for London at regular intervals, so a better understanding of the environmental performance of its estate can be reached and assets can be future-proofed effectively. Places for London will also share the environmental performance data it holds with its tenants and will look to provide useful tips and advice to support them in becoming more sustainable. The updated lease will also see tenants commit to not making any changes or additions to their property that will lead to a lower Energy Performance Certificate Rating.",0.3166978789757337,Mon,0.95,1.16,1.07,1,0.76,0.84,0.92,0.93,0.84,1.0066225165562914,1.0131004366812226,1.0338164251207729,1.0139416983523448,0.9612648221343874,0.9831748354059985,1.0006798096532972,0.9867374005305041,0.9940828402366864,1.0048599199542596,0.9930013303256405,1.0333442088091354,1.0061182868796736,0.9443722005490536,0.9734537124376769,1.0675029400235203,0.9733384262796029,0.9808233188442853

Customers are advised to check before they travel using TfL's Journey Planner or the TfL Go app
The majority of the Transport for London (TfL) network will be running over the Easter weekend, however there will be some closures for essential maintenance and improvement works.

Customers are advised to plan journeys ahead and check before they travel. TfL's Journey Planner or the TfL Go app will help customers avoid any closures and navigate any last-minute service changes.

There will be planned closures taking place between 29 March and 1 April to allow for essential works on the Elizabeth line, parts of the London Overground, DLR and London Trams. This work is vital for improving reliability and ensuring the safety of customers. A good service is expected on all other parts of the TfL network.

Customers can continue to take advantage of walking and cycling routes. Victoria Coach Station, Santander Cycles, rental e-scooters and taxi and private hire services will be available throughout the Easter period. The IFS Cloud Cable Car is also open throughout.

Glynn Barton, TfL's Chief Operating Officer, said: ""The majority of our network will be running over the Easter weekend to help everyone make the most of the city. However, there will be some closures to allow for essential safety works and service upgrades and we advise customers to plan ahead and check their routes before traveling to ensure a smooth journey.

""There are plenty of alternative travel options available, and information can be found on the TfL website and through TfL travel tools including the TfL Go app.""

Customers are reminded to touch in and out using the same Oyster, contactless card or mobile device in order to be charged the correct fare for their journey. With the Hopper fare, customers can also make unlimited bus and tram journeys within an hour for just £1.75.

Due to essential planned engineering works the following closures will take place over the Easter Bank Holiday weekend:

The Elizabeth line will not run through the central section, from Paddington to Abbey Wood and Shenfield. A reduced service will operate between Paddington and Maidenhead/Heathrow Terminal 4. Westbound services from Shenfield will terminate at London Liverpool Street National Rail station, above ground, and will not be stopping at Whitechapel station. This is to allow for signalling software updates, which will result in fewer delays and more reliable journeys.
The London Overground will not run from Highbury & Islington to New Cross Gate, New Cross, and Clapham Junction for the entire weekend. This includes no Night Overground services. On Sunday 31 March it will not run between Sydenham and Crystal Palace. Rail replacement buses will operate in the daytime, and alternative London Overground services will be available. Local bus services are also recommended, particularly during night hours. Closures will take place to allow for station improvements at Surrey Quays, where a new station entrance and step-free access are being installed. Works on the branch to Crystal Palace are to improve signalling on the line to facilitate a more reliable service. The London Overground will not run from Sunday 31 March to Monday 1 April from Liverpool Street to Enfield Town, Cheshunt, and Chingford. All other London Overground lines will be running with the expectation of a good service.
The DLR will not run between Stratford and West India Quay, Westferry and Canning Town, and Tower Gateway and Shadwell. This is to replace parts of the track to improve safety, reliability, and provide a smoother ride for customers.
From Friday 29 March to Wednesday 24 April, London Trams will not run from East Croydon to Beckenham Junction, Elmers End, and New Addington. This is to allow critical works to take place at East Croydon and Sandilands Junction. Tram replacement bus services and an increased frequency of local buses in these areas will be available. Customers are advised to use alternative routes, plan ahead and allow more time for their journey.

Woolwich Ferry is a free service that provides an important link from Woolwich to North Woolwich for thousands of passengers every day
The new service will make it quicker and easier for people to travel in east and southeast London
Transport for London (TfL) has introduced a new and enhanced timetable on the Woolwich Ferry, with passengers now benefitting from a two-vessel service in operation every day of the week, in addition to extended operating hours. Ferry services now operate longer hours on weekdays and weekends, with services running every 15 minutes from 05:00 to 21:00.  

TfL has also introduced a two-vessel service at the weekend, doubling its frequency, helping to reduce waiting times and offer better and more reliable connections with the capital's transport network. The extended operating hours are part of TfL's commitment to make it easier and more affordable to travel around the capital. The ferry is located nearby other important transport modes, including the Elizabeth line and the new SL2 Superloop route, which runs an express service between Walthamstow Central and North Woolwich. The ferry also provides an important link for people travelling on foot or by cycle, enabling them to cross the river for free. 

The improved timetable was introduced in response to customer research carried out that has shown a demand for longer operating hours.   

Darren Ellis, Woolwich Ferry General Manager, said: ""We are delighted to be able to offer a new and improved timetable for the Woolwich Ferry, with passengers able to benefit from more frequent journeys and longer operating hours. We recognise how important this service is, particularly to local users, and will continue to work hard to enhance the ferry's service and long-term reliability. This is just one of the ways the Mayor and TfL are continuing to improve the capital's river services, which is key to building a better and more efficient London for everyone.""

Route 108 will be temporarily split and terminate at Canning Town station and North Greenwich, with customers asked to use the Jubilee line to cross the river to complete their journeys with subsequent refunds available if required 
Transport for London (TfL) has today (Wednesday 08 May) advised drivers that the Blackwall Tunnel will be closed to southbound traffic across a number of weekends in May and June to help support carriageway works on the northbound Blackwall Tunnel approach. 

The closures, which are required to help implement the road configuration for the new Silvertown Tunnel, which will open in 2025, will take place across the weekends of 18-20 May, 1-3 June, 8-10 June and 29 June - 1 July.

During these weekends, a range of works will be undertaken, including resurfacing roads and pavements on the tunnel approaches, installing safety barriers, work to retaining walls and carrying out landscaping. The closures will all start at 00:01 on the Saturday morning, with southbound traffic being restored by 05:00 on the Monday morning at the latest. Further information about the closures can be found at www.tfl.gov.uk/blackwall-tunnel  

The Silvertown Tunnel, which is within the Ultra Low Emission Zone and will be subject to a user charge, will provide a public transport-focused river crossing with zero-emission bus links across the Thames. Once open in 2025, the crossing will also reduce congestion and improve the reliability and resilience of the Blackwall Tunnel, which will improve overall air quality in the local area. 

Across the weekends, the Blackwall Tunnel will be closed for southbound traffic and drivers will need to take alternative routes. Northbound traffic will not be affected by these closures as traffic will be diverted through the southbound Blackwall Tunnel when required. Drivers are advised to plan their routes in advance, checking before they travel so they can consider any other potential traffic impacts or restrictions, such as the height and weight limits at Rotherhithe Tunnel and Tower Bridge, both of which are outside the Congestion Charge zone. Traffic around Rotherhithe Tunnel and along the A13 Commercial Road is expected to be heavier than normal over the weekends due to the closures. The Woolwich Ferry, which now depart every fifteen minutes, seven days a week, will also be in operation across the weekends. 

Drivers of HGVs, as well as vans more than two metres in height or weighing more than two tonnes, are advised to consider routes away from central London across the weekends where possible. To help inform drivers, additional variable messaging signs will be placed on the main roads approaching the Blackwall Tunnel. TfL has also worked with third party app providers, such as Waze, to help ensure drivers who regularly use the Blackwall Tunnel are alerted to the southbound closure and that the closure is shown in any route-planning over the weekend. TfL will also take the opportunity to carry out works within and around the tunnel, to help deliver future maintenance work more efficiently and ensure the tunnel can continue to safely operate.  

Nick Fairholme, Director of Capital Delivery - Systems at TfL, said: ""We are getting closer to the opening of the new Silvertown Tunnel and appreciate that these planned weekend works will have an impact on some drivers. We are doing everything in our power to limit potential disruption and complete these essential works as quickly as possible, including ensuring a northbound route through the Blackwall Tunnel is maintained throughout."" 

The route 108, the only bus route that operates through the Blackwall Tunnel, will be split in two, operating between both Lewisham and North Greenwich and between Canning Town and Stratford. Customers are advised to then change onto the Jubilee line to cross the river to complete their journeys. TfL will also ensure that customers of the route 108 who then use the Jubilee line as part of their journey over the weekend will avoid being charged for the Tube section of their journey via an automatic refund which will be processed after the weekend. The Mayor's Hopper fare will also mean that customers won't be charged for any additional bus journeys on the other side of the river, providing they begin within an hour of touching in on the first bus. From 00:01 on the Monday mornings of the closure, northbound buses will return to their normal route and southbound buses will be diverted via Tower Bridge until the tunnel is re-opened to southbound traffic. 

Work on delivering the new Silvertown Tunnel, which will open in 2025, continues to progress. Both of the 1.1km tunnels have now been fully tunnelled, with the 'cut and cover' sections now virtually covered. Following approval by local councils, landscaping works in Greenwich are now taking place as worksites are no longer required.  

Throughout 2024, work will also continue to install the safety critical systems within the tunnel, as well as complete work on the tunnel portals. Work is also progressing on the new road layout around Tidal Basin Roundabout in Newham, including new walking and cycling paths to make it easier for people accessing the Royal Docks via the Lower Lea Crossing.

2024-05-14,May, TfL celebrates 25 years since the Jubilee line extension connected the West End and London Docklands,"TfL celebrates 25 years since the Jubilee line extension connected Green Park to London's booming Docklands area and linked all London's Tube lines
 
 




 ""The Jubilee line extension was a remarkable feat that changed the geography of our city as we saw in the new millennium""
 
 Dale Smith
 Head of Customer Operations on the Jubilee line
 


 
All 11 new stations featured modern design led by architect Roland Paoletti to herald the new millennium and were built step-free, with lifts, ramps and level surfaces for people with accessibility requirements
Today, TfL is working on more than 80 ambitious new actions from its Equity in Motion plan to make the Tube and wider transport network accessible and inclusive for all 
To celebrate, TfL has created special 25th anniversary posters that will feature along the Jubilee line over the coming weeks
Transport for London (TfL) is celebrating 25 years since the Jubilee line extension was completed with special anniversary posters along the line. The major engineering project connected the West End to the rapidly developing Docklands in the late 1990s, linking every Tube line and making travel in London more accessible.

While the original Jubilee line opened in May 1979 between Stanmore and Charing Cross, the extension to London Underground's youngest line was completed in three phases. This began in May 1999 between Stratford, the line's current eastern terminus and where Stratford International and Westfield Shopping Centre would later open, and North Greenwich, close to the Millennium Dome. It then extended further west to Bermondsey via the bustling financial hub of Canary Wharf, transformed in the 1980s and 1990s by the London Docklands Development Corporation. By the end of the year, with the new millennium on the horizon, the extension was completely open from Stratford to Green Park, creating the line as we know it today that links the north west and east of the city.

Over the course of 25 years London's landscape has changed dramatically, and today the Jubilee line remains unique in providing interchanges with every Tube line, the DLR and six national rail stations, as well as Overground stations and the more recently added Elizabeth line. The 1999 extension brought 11 new stations in total, each with 'future-proof' architectural design led by Roland Paoletti, with each of the stations designed by a different architect under his guidance, to ring in the new millennium. A prime example is Canada Water station, which was built with glass walls to allow natural light to filter through the station to the platforms.

Each of the new stations offered step-free access from the street to the Tube platforms. Lifts, ramps and level surfaces enabled people with accessibility requirements to avoid stairs and escalators. The extension significantly increased the number of step-free access stations in London, and while more than a third of all stations across the city today provide step-free access, TfL is working towards the Mayor's ambitious goal of 50 per cent of Tube stations to be step-free. Plans are afoot to make West Hampstead, part of the original Jubilee line, step-free, and a feasibility study is looking at the same for Finchley Road. Mini ramps are now in place at 47 step-free to train Tube stations where there is a small gap between the platform and trains. Mini ramps will be installed at an additional 22 stations this summer, allowing for even smoother transitions on and off trains.

Dale Smith, Head of Customer Operations on the Jubilee line, said: ""The Jubilee line extension was a remarkable feat that changed the geography of our city as we saw in the new millennium. Creating a fast, reliable connection between the West End and the thriving Docklands area brought significant economic rewards for the city and more homes for thousands of Londoners. The extension also helped to lay the foundation for our ongoing accessibility work to ensure all Londoners can make the most of what our city has to offer.

""The Mayor and TfL continue to develop our world-class transport offer, in the past few years completing the Elizabeth line, Northern line extensions and installing 4G across the network.""

2024-05-14,May, More stations and Tube lines across Central London get high-speed mobile coverage,"Paddington, Whitechapel, Canary Wharf and Woolwich on the Elizabeth line now have 4G coverage - meaning all stations along this line now have mobile coverage
 
 




 ""A city's infrastructure is what underpins a good visitor experience and being able to stay in touch with friends and family is a major component of this, so we are delighted to see mobile coverage being expanded on the TfL network""

Victoria and Piccadilly line customers now starting to benefit from 4G and 5G mobile coverage, with further stations and tunnelled sections going live through Central London later this month
Around 25 per cent of Tube stations which are 'underground' now have mobile coverage
New map by TfL highlights expected coverage by end of summer 2024, showing large sections of the Tube network across the West End and southern end of the Northern line fully connected for the first time
The Mayor has committed to completing work across all of the London Underground, Docklands Light Railway, London Overground and the Elizabeth line by the end of 2025
All Elizabeth line stations now have 4G mobile coverage as the Mayor and TfL's programme to improve connectivity for those travelling underground continues.

Paddington, Canary Wharf, Whitechapel and Woolwich stations all recently gained 4G mobile coverage - meaning that all Elizabeth line stations now have mobile coverage - from ticket halls all the way to the platforms. Work to deliver coverage within the tunnelled sections of the Elizabeth line continues, with the first sections between Bond Street and Liverpool Street expected to get coverage within the coming month, with the whole line completed later this year.

Providing uninterrupted mobile coverage provides additional reassurance to those travelling on the network, making it easier for customers to stay in touch with friends and family as well as allow staff to better provide information and better assist customers with their journeys. The system, delivered in partnership with Boldyn Networks, will also host the new Emergency Services Network (ESN), which when fully operational, will give first responders immediate access to life-saving data, images and information in live situations and emergencies on the frontline. 

Following line testing to ensure that the introduction of 4G and 5G mobile coverage would not impact existing safety systems required to run a safe and reliable network, the tunnelled section between Euston and Warren Street on the Victoria line, as well as Covent Garden station on the Piccadilly line, have also both begun receiving mobile coverage. The tunnelled sections between Piccadilly Circus and Hyde Park Corner on the Piccadilly line will also go live in the coming weeks, meaning more customers heading to and from the West End can stay better connected while travelling underground.

Next month, coverage will also begin on the Bakerloo line, further helping those travelling through central London stay in touch. The southern end of the Northern line from Stockwell to Morden will also start to get mobile coverage shortly, with 4G and 5G coverage due to become available at Clapham Common station next week, and further tunnels and stations going live during the summer.

The introduction of high-speed mobile coverage by TfL and Boldyn Networks means that customers can stay better connected as they travel to and from the West End to shop, meet friends and visit the area's theatres, restaurants and bars. All four mobile network operators - Three UK, EE, Vodafone, and Virgin Media O2 (VMO2) - are taking part in the rollout.

Currently, around 31 out of 121 Tube stations with platforms that are underground, and therefore usually unable to get a mobile signal, as well as connecting tunnels, have mobile coverage. This is around 25 percent of stations which are 'underground, and when combined with Tube stations which are above ground, means that more than two thirds of all stations on the Tube network now have mobile coverage available.

To highlight this, TfL has updated its map to show the expected coverage by the end of summer 2024. This continued progress means that a significant proportion of the entire Tube network (around 80 per cent of stations across the network) as well as the entire Elizabeth line, remain on track to have mobile coverage by the end of 2024.

The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said: ""This is yet another step towards ensuring Londoners and visitors can stay connected on our transport network. I promised that customers would be able to access high-speed mobile coverage at all stations and in tunnels, and I'm pleased to see how quickly the team are moving to enable 4G and 5G connectivity.

""Now, customers can access the latest travel information, keep in touch with colleagues, friends and family, use social media and stream music at every station along the Elizabeth line. This is just one of the many ways we are supporting Londoners as we build a better, fairer and more prosperous London for everyone.""

Shashi Verma, Chief Technology Officer at TfL said: ""It's great to see that all Elizabeth line stations, and even more Tube stations, now have high-quality mobile coverage for the first time. This programme is gathering pace and we are working hard to bring the benefits of being able to stay in contact while travelling through our city as quickly as possible.""

Billy D'Arcy, CEO of UK & Ireland at Boldyn Networks, said: ""With all Elizabeth lines stations now offering 4G mobile coverage, this milestone shows the rapid progress of our work to deploy connectivity across the London Underground. Customers can  stay connected with friends and family at some of the busiest stations across central London, and with further expansion of connectivity throughout the summer period, this will help to create a safer and smarter city for residents, businesses and visitors.

Ruth Duston, CEO and Founder of Primera, which operates 12 central London business improvement districts, said: ""A city's infrastructure is what underpins a good visitor experience and being able to stay in touch with friends and family is a major component of this, so we are delighted to see mobile coverage being expanded on the TfL network. As well as enabling Londoners and tourists alike to navigate our city and to find out about things to do near them, this is also a welcome milestone for London's reputation as a global tech capital.""

A Royal Borough of Greenwich spokesperson said: ""We're delighted that both Woolwich and Abbey Wood stations now have mobile coverage, a great additional benefit for residents and visitors who live, work and explore our beautiful borough.""

The project is being implemented by Boldyn Networks, one of the world's leading neutral host network providers, who was awarded a 20-year concession by TfL in June 2021 to deliver high speed, 5G-ready mobile connectivity across the entire London Underground network. Boldyn Networks, formerly BAI Communications, is installing a fibre backbone across the capital to improve connectivity both above and below ground, bringing wide reaching socio-economic benefits to local businesses and communities.

Around 500 people are working overnight across the Tube network to install mobile equipment, with all works needed to be tidied away before the network opens for customers every morning. Once fully delivered, more than 2,000 kilometres of cabling as well as thousands of radios are expected to be installed within tunnels and stations, all of which will be fitted outside of operational hours.

2024-05-15,May, More accessible journeys for DLR customers as a new pre-booked assistance trial gets underway,"Access DLR is a new six-month trial which allows customers to pre-book assistance when travelling on the DLR
 
 




 ""KeolisAmey Docklands is excited to be delivering the Access DLR trial, in collaboration with TfL and its Independent Disability Advisory Group""
 
 Richard Graham
 Managing Director at KeolisAmey Docklands
 


 
Customers requiring assistance can book online or by phone and the trial will run daily between 07:00 and 19:00 
This follows TfL's recent Equity in Motion plan, which includes more than 80 commitments to make London's transport network more accessible and inclusive for all
Global Accessibility Awareness Day runs on the 16 May each year
Transport for London (TfL) and KeolisAmey Docklands (KAD) have launched a six-month trial to help make journeys on the DLR more accessible. The new Access DLR trial aims to enable customers to travel who may otherwise encounter barriers.

DLR customers will be able to pre-book an available timeslot for assistance with their journeys online or by phone at least two hours before their journey for travel seven days a week between 07:00 and 19:00. Short-notice requests can also be made by phone for travel assistance less than two hours before a customer's planned DLR journey and these will be subject to staff availability at the time of travel.

Customers with a confirmed booking will be met at the start of their DLR journey (or other requested location on the network) by clearly identifiable Access DLR staff, who can accompany them throughout their DLR journey to provide the requested travel support.*  Feedback will be gathered throughout the trial on how the service works, hours of operation and potential demand for the service beyond the six month trial.

Access DLR is open to anyone aged 18 and over who requires assistance to travel, covering a wide range of needs including mobility, visual impairments and mental health. Users will not be asked for any proof of disability to use the service.

This trial follows other major improvement projects for DLR services with new trains set to start to be introduced by the end of 2024. TfL is introducing 54 new trains to the DLR fleet to replace the oldest trains, some of which are over 30 years old. This will help improve the frequency and reliability of services and offer better facilities for those with mobility impairments and accessibility needs. The new trains feature spacious and more accessible walk-through carriages, three multi-use areas for large items like prams and luggage, in addition to three dedicated wheelchair spaces and improved audio and visual real-time travel information.

Seb Dance, Deputy Mayor for Transport, said: ""Creating an inclusive transport network is an essential part of the Mayor's Transport Strategy. With the Access DLR trial, we're striving to make every journey as seamless and accessible as possible for all passengers. By gathering feedback and delivering improvements, we're building a fairer, more inclusive London for everyone.""

Trish Ashton, TfL's Director of Rail and Sponsored services, said: ""Making London more accessible and inclusive is a priority for TfL. DLR stations have been step-free since it was introduced, but we know that only addresses one element of accessibility. Access DLR, along with the new DLR trains, will make the DLR network more widely accessible to the growing community around east and southeast London. We hope that more Londoners will feel comfortable using DLR services with these improvements in place.""

Richard Graham, Managing Director at KeolisAmey Docklands, said: ""KeolisAmey Docklands is excited to be delivering the Access DLR trial, in collaboration with TfL and its Independent Disability Advisory Group. We are committed to continuously improving the accessibility of the DLR and supporting TfL's wider Equity in Motion plan. We look forward to the invaluable customer feedback this trial will provide.""

Liam O'Carroll, London Sight Loss Councils, said: ""London Sight Loss Councils welcomes this new trial. The ability to pre-book assistance on DLR journeys should really enhance blind, partially sighted and disabled passengers' travel experience on the network and remove much of the anxiety associated with navigating DLR stations. We also welcome that the service can be booked by phone which is hugely important for those who find booking online a barrier. We hope that London residents, including blind and partially sighted people, will feel encouraged to make greater use of the DLR and urge everyone to give as much feedback as possible on the service to help the operator understand its impact. We will continue working with partners to make transport accessible.""

TfL recently launched Equity in Motion, a plan with more than 80 actions to make London transport fairer, more accessible and more inclusive. The plan's commitments include:

Working to meet the Mayor's aim of increasing the proportion of step-free Tube stations from a third to half
Introducing mini ramps to cover the gap between the train and platform at all London Underground platforms that are step-free to train
Launching an innovation challenge aimed at improving travel for disabled people

2024-05-21,May, London schoolchildren make strides towards a sustainable future at TfL award ceremony,"Twenty-seven London schools recognised for their efforts to increase walking and cycling, with seven recognised as overall winners in their categories at TfL awards ceremony at Kia Oval
 
 




 ""Each and every school taking part in TfL Travel for Life is doing something remarkable to encourage healthier and more sustainable travel habits, so it was incredibly tough to whittle it down to just seven winning schools""
 
 Lilli Matson
 TfL's Chief Safety, Health and Environment Officer
 


 
TfL Travel for Life schools programme, delivered in partnership with London Transport Museum's schools team and London boroughs, has supported the next generation of Londoners to travel towards a brighter, safer and more sustainable future for the last 17 years
Awards ceremony coincides with 'Walk to School' Week, run by charity Living Streets to encourage children to travel actively to school every day of the week
Seven London schools have been awarded for increasing walking and cycling as part of Transport for London's (TfL) Travel for Life schools accreditation programme, delivered in partnership with London Transport Museum's schools team and London boroughs. The programme's aim to reduce cars on the school run reflects TfL's wider work for a brighter, safer and more sustainable London.

More than half of schools in the capital currently take part in TfL Travel for Life - formally known as the STARS programme - an inspiring and free accreditation programme for schools to get more children walking and cycling, in turn reducing congestion, improving road safety, health and wellbeing. Schools can achieve Gold accreditation either by reducing car use by six per cent or having more than 90 per cent of students walking and cycling to school.

Each year the TfL Travel for Life Top School Awards recognises schools that have gone the extra mile to champion active travel. With a high standard of entries this year from 200 schools, Will Norman, London's Walking & Cycling Commissioner and other industry leaders, announced the winning school for each of the seven categories at a ceremony at Kia Oval. Twenty other schools were also recognised at the ceremony for their impressive achievements towards increasing active and sustainable travel to and from their schools.

Two Hillingdon schools each won a category. Belmore Primary Academy scooped Best Newcomer award for incorporating road safety messaging and sustainable travel into its school ethos, having only joined the programme in 2022. Meanwhile Guru Nanak Sikh Academy won the Mode Shift Impact award for reducing car use, proactively pushing the message to the wider school community. Nearby Oaklands Primary School in Ealing won the Creativity and Innovation award for its inspired training programme on pedestrian safety.

Bullers Wood School for Boys in Bromley came first for the Best Campaign award with its campaign to reduce car use and increase active travel, and easy-to-read Active Travel Zone map. In the Royal Borough of Greenwich, Discovery Primary School won the Best School Champion for Cheryl Van Cooten, a staff member who led by example, documenting her own journey to school.

In the north of the city, Islington's Gillespie Primary School triumphed in the Student Achievement category for a student group who have delivered assemblies on active travel for all key stages. The Long-Term Excellence award went to Mission Grove Primary School in Waltham Forest, which has maintained its Gold status for 16 consecutive years.

The seven schools were awarded during Walk to School Week, an annual campaign run by charity Living Streets that encourages students to reap the benefits of walking and cycling to school. The campaign's theme this year is 'The Magic of Walking', with a focus each day of the school week on nature, movement, happiness, friendship and community respectively.

London's Walking and Cycling Commissioner, Will Norman, said: ""We know that children who are introduced to active travel from a young age are more likely to continue the habit into adulthood, so it's fantastic to see so many schools encouraging more students to walk and cycle, inspiring the next generation of Londoners to work towards a more sustainable future.

""Every one of these schools is doing vital work to ensure a brighter, safer and more sustainable London for everyone.""

Lilli Matson, TfL's Chief Safety, Health and Environment Officer, said: ""Each and every school taking part in TfL Travel for Life is doing something remarkable to encourage healthier and more sustainable travel habits, so it was incredibly tough to whittle it down to just seven winning schools. It's so inspiring to see this enthusiasm and these ideas coming from the younger generation. We hope the momentum built up this week with Living Streets' campaign will encourage schools who aren't yet involved with TfL Travel for Life to sign up for a brighter, safer and more sustainable future.""

Elizabeth McKay, Director and CEO, London Transport Museum, said: ""We're incredibly proud to collaborate with TfL and London boroughs on the delivery of Travel for Life. Through our work with students in schools across London and by reviewing the incredible award submissions, we have seen their immense dedication to active travel - whether that be walking, cycling, or scooting to school.

Kathryn Shaw, Head of Communications, Living Streets, said: ""Walk to School Week is the perfect opportunity to celebrate the strides pupils across London are taking to get more active on the journey to school, helping to reduce congestion, pollution and road danger along the way.

2024-05-22,May, Reminder: Colindale Tube station to close from Friday 7 June until December 2024 as part of its major upgrade,"Colindale station on the Edgware branch of the Northern line will temporarily close from 7 June to allow vital upgrade work to continue, including the removal of the existing canopy and staircases and the installation of new staircases
 
 




 ""Work is progressing well on the much-needed major upgrade of Colindale station and is set to transform the journeys of many thousands of our customers, making the station more accessible and welcoming, and ensuring it's fit to serve this rapidly growing community for many decades to come""

Customers advised to take local bus services to Burnt Oak or Hendon Central (Northern line) or Mill Hill Broadway (Thameslink) to continue their journeys
An additional bus route (NL6), free of charge, will run every 15 minutes on weekdays at peak times between Colindale and Hendon Central, and relevant journeys on the route 186 bus will be refunded automatically
From December 2024, a temporary pedestrian passageway will open to allow customers to access the platforms at Colindale via the existing ticket hall and new staircases, ahead of the station upgrade finishing in autumn 2025
A series of associated planned track closures of the Northern line between Edgware and Golders Green continues, with the next closure scheduled for the weekend of 8 - 9 June
Transport for London (TfL) is reminding customers who use Colindale Tube station that vital work to upgrade the station, including a larger ticket hall and installation of a lift to give the station step-free access for the first time, means that it will close from Friday 7 June until December 2024. 

Work on the station's major upgrade started earlier this year, with funding from the Government's Levelling Up Fund and significant contributions from Barnet Council, local developers and TfL. 

During the temporary closure of the station, customers are advised to take local bus services to Burnt Oak or Hendon Central (Northern line) or Mill Hill Broadway (Thameslink) to continue their journeys. An additional bus route (NL6), free of charge, will run every 15 minutes on weekdays at peak times between Colindale and Hendon Central. In addition, customers travelling on bus route 186 between Mill Hill Broadway and Hendon Central stations will have their bus fares refunded automatically, when using Contactless or Oyster cards, and after touching in or out at one of these two stations. Normal TfL and Thameslink fares will apply on all other journeys. 

In its current configuration, Colindale Tube station is expected to reach passenger capacity by 2026. As part of the upgrade, the 1960s-built entrance is being replaced with a new, landmark station building, which includes a spacious ticket hall and a lift giving step-free access from street to platform for the first time (with existing platform humps giving level access onto trains). 

In addition to the temporary closure of Colindale Tube station, a series of associated planned track closures of the Northern line between Golders Green and Edgware are continuing this summer to facilitate the upgrade works. These planned closures are necessary due to the proximity to the track of some of the construction work to upgrade Colindale station - including piling, crane operation and demolition work - meaning it cannot be safely carried out when trains are running. For the duration of each of these track closures, bus route NL1 will run between Golders Green station and Canons Park (for Jubilee line services) with stops near Brent Cross station, at Hendon Central, Colindale, Burnt Oak, Canons Park and Edgware stations. Customers will not be charged to use this service. Southbound services on the London Underground from Golders Green will not be affected. 

Travel advice for customers affected by these closures is available at TfL travel advice - Colindale.

During the track closures, TfL is taking the opportunity to carry out engineering works which will help improve overall services along this section of the Northern line, offering a more reliable and comfortable service for customers. 

Colindale is one of London's most deprived areas and the redevelopment of the Tube station is central to enabling the building of 11,400 quality new homes for local people. Since 2011, Colindale's population has grown by 70 per cent, making the area around the station the second-fastest growing ward in London after the Stratford Olympic Park in Newham. The upgraded Tube station will increase capacity, improve accessibility and provide a more comfortable and welcoming environment for TfL's customers. 

Stuart Harvey, TfL's Chief Capital Officer, said: ""Work is progressing well on the much-needed major upgrade of Colindale station and is set to transform the journeys of many thousands of our customers, making the station more accessible and welcoming, and ensuring it's fit to serve this rapidly growing community for many decades to come. I apologise for the inevitable disruption that this upgrade will cause for our customers but we are committed to doing everything we can to ensure that, through our detailed travel advice, they can plan ahead and are able to complete their journeys using the public transport network."" 

Cllr Barry Rawlings, Leader of Barnet Council, said: ""Colindale is one of the fastest growing neighbourhoods in London, with a population that has expanded by 70 per cent over the last 10 years. The redevelopment of the Tube station is desperately needed as it reaches capacity by 2026 and, left undone, will stifle our plans to further regenerate the area. 

""I'm really pleased that TfL is arranging the additional free NL6 bus service, as well as the innovative auto-refunds for those making relevant journeys using the 186 bus route. This will help those who normally use the Tube station for the duration of the works. We look forward to seeing the new, larger, fully accessible station next year."" 

Delivering step-free access at Colindale station will continue TfL's work to make the capital's transport network more accessible. Today, more than a third of Underground stations across the city provide step-free access. TfL is working towards the Mayor's ambitious goal of making 50 per cent of Tube stations step-free. 

TfL is running a widescale communications campaign ahead of the temporary closure of Colindale station and the associated track closures which includes targeted customer emails, posters and PA announcements at stations. TfL's Journey Planner and TfL Go are also updated with the latest travel information. TfL is encouraging customers to use these real-time travel tools to plan ahead during these essential closures.",0.3133322091938865,Wed,0.94,1.18,1.05,0.99,0.84,0.85,0.8,0.97,0.87,0.9721559268098647,1.0039267015706808,0.9978070175438596,0.9757391963608794,1.026315789473684,0.9778761061946902,0.9480401093892435,1.0104166666666667,1.0143497757847535,0.9942824471126357,1.010122042917462,1.0140293637846656,0.996057104010877,1.0437798006068486,0.9850424471095539,0.9282634261074089,1.0152024446142094,1.015852723088724
2024-05-24,May, The Elizabeth line continues to transform travel in London on its two-year anniversary,"The Elizabeth line has seen more than 350 million journeys since it opened two years ago  
 
 



 
Between June 2022 and October 2023, Elizabeth line passenger demand grew by around 40 per cent, the fastest in the UK 
Forecasts suggest further growth in 2024/25 with passenger journeys increasing by a further 8 per cent  
The Elizabeth line has directly impacted the development of 55,000 new homes, with 60 per cent of employment growth in greater London within 1km of an Elizabeth line station
Two years on from the official opening of the transformational Elizabeth line, Transport for London (TfL) can reveal the positive impact the line has had on travel and the economy in London and the surrounding areas. The Elizabeth line is the fastest growing railway in the UK with more than 350 million journeys being made on the line since opening in May 2022, significantly helping to drive recovery from the pandemic by creating new journey opportunities, supporting regeneration across the capital, and increasing housing and social opportunities, while adding an estimated £42bn to the UK economy.

During its first full year of operation, the Elizabeth line saw more than 150 million passenger journeys. In 2023/24, there were 210 million journeys made on the Elizabeth line, a dramatic increase. Passenger demand is already above the post-pandemic expectations for the end of the decade and is expected to increase further.

On average, there are around 700,000 passenger journeys on the line every weekday, with the busiest day recorded on 18 April 2024 when there were 787,000 journeys across the line. The busiest station is Tottenham Court Road, followed by Liverpool Street.

Forecasts for the 2024/25 financial year paint a positive picture for Elizabeth line growth, with journeys expected to rise to 226 million for the year, a further increase of eight per cent from 2023/24. To date, the highest demand growth on the line has been between Reading and Hayes & Harlington, which has seen an 80 per cent increase in demand on TfL services, while demand to Heathrow terminals has increased by 64 per cent, since through-running services were introduced in November 2022.

The railway has also helped to drive regeneration along the length of the route. It has had a direct impact on the development and delivery of 55,000 new homes, with further potential to deliver 15,000 new homes and 8,000 jobs. Abbey Wood is one of the largest regeneration areas in London. To date, it has seen a six per cent increase in new homes, with the expectation to see further development over the next five years. In West London, the highest growth rates are in Southall and Hayes & Harlington, the latter has also seen an increase in social housing developments being built. 60 per cent of employment growth within greater London, during the Elizabeth line build between 2015 and 2022, has been within 1km of an Elizabeth line station.

The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said:

'The Elizabeth line has been a game-changer for our city, transforming travel across London and the South East and delivering a £42bn boost to the UK economy. In just two years, more than 350 million journeys have been made and the line has directly impacted the development of 55,000 new homes and significantly supported employment growth.

'The Elizabeth line has played a vital role in our recovery from the pandemic and is helping to build a fairer, greener and more prosperous London for everyone.'

Howard Smith, TfL's Director of the Elizabeth line, said:

'The Elizabeth line has rightly and quickly become one of the most popular railways in the country. It has also been one of the most reliable, and earlier this year we achieved our best quarterly performance so far. The Elizabeth line continues to be transformational for people travelling across London and the South East. The huge numbers of customers using our accessible trains and stations is a real testament to the importance of the railway investment and to all those involved in keeping it running.'

John Lewis, Peabody's Executive Director for Thamesmead, said:

'The Elizabeth line has made a huge difference to thousands of people, as well as the growing number of businesses and services in South Thamesmead. It shows that high quality transport links are one of the foundations of a successful place, bringing about significant local social and economic benefits. Improving connectivity across the whole of Thamesmead is a key part of our long-term plan to improve, grow and look after the town. It's why we're continuing to support TfL and other stakeholders with proposals to bring the DLR to the north of Thamesmead. Supported by the right transport infrastructure, this part of Thamesmead has the potential to deliver up to 15,000 new homes, thousands of jobs and an improved expanded town centre.'

Marcel Baettig, Chief Executive Officer at Bow Arts Clubs, said:

'Since the opening of the Elizabeth line our artists have been able to feel properly connected to their clients, to opportunities and to networks and friends and Abbey Wood has become a more exciting place to be.

'In 2019 Bow Arts moved to Abbey Wood and renovated the iconic Lakeside Center, the plan was for it to be London's next creative hub, supporting young artists, designers and makers helping them establish their careers and contribute to London as a World Capital of Culture. For this to work the place had to be interesting, affordable and above all connected.  Without this vital third piece of the puzzle the artists businesses simply would not survive, and the Elizabeth line was that final piece of the puzzle that we needed.'

The Elizabeth line has also improved step-free access across the TfL network, with all 41 stations across the line step-free from street to platform and all central section stations being fully accessible from street to train, with staff available from first to last train should manual boarding be required. Elizabeth line trains have four dedicated wheelchair spaces in the fifth carriage, close to the doors to allow quick boarding. Ten multi-use spaces are on each train for those travelling with buggies, luggage and cycles, making travelling on the Elizabeth line a perfect option for all.",0.2918473595923426,Fri,1.01,1.21,1.05,1.05,0.8,0.87,0.86,0.94,0.84,1.0445505171042164,1.029450261780105,0.9978070175438596,1.0348749052312358,0.9774436090225564,1.0008849557522124,1.0191431175934367,0.9791666666666666,0.979372197309417,1.0683247570040022,1.035803111805194,1.0140293637846656,1.0564242012236573,0.9940760005779512,1.008219916453308,0.9978831830654645,0.9838044308632543,0.9808233188442853
2024-05-24,May, TfL launches major new initiative to encourage Londoners to try cycling on Sundays,"TfL Cycle Sundays encourages Londoners, including those that are new to cycling, to get out ahead of the summer and enjoy the capital by cycle with a range of support including leisure routes, cycling discounts, training and how to cycle safely via the new TfL Cycle Sundays website
 
 



 
There will be leisurely, easy to follow cycle routes across London for novice cyclists of all backgrounds and abilities, available on the website and in the TfL Cycle Sundays Club in the Strava app
TfL continues work on expanding the Cycleway network across the capital to make cycling more accessible to all Londoners
Leisure cycling provides a boost to physical and mental health and is vital to encouraging more people to travel around the capital by cycle  
Transport for London (TfL) is launching a major new programme of leisurely cycle routes and support to encourage Londoners who are new to cycling to explore the capital by cycle on Sundays. TfL Cycle Sundays, which has been developed in collaboration with leading cycling organisations, aims to offer beginner friendly journeys for Londoners, backed up by a range of support to make it even easier to try out cycling for the first time. Leisure cycling provides people with an easy and sustainable way to maintain their mental and physical wellbeing and build up confidence.

The routes have been selected by TfL and a range of partners including British Cycling, Cycle Sisters, JoyRiders, London Cycling Campaign, Sustrans and Wheels for Wellbeing, and include park rides in Greenwich and Battersea, an accessible cycle tour of Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, a loop through parks in Haringey and many more spanning the capital. The routes give cyclists of all abilities a choice of leisure routes up to ten miles long on quiet roads and paths.

A full list of routes can be found on the TfL Cycle Sundays website, which also offers cycling discounts, links to cycling organisations and their events and access to our free online Cycle Skills course for new cyclists or anyone who needs a refresher to get cycling again.

TfL has partnered with Strava for another easy way to access and track leisure routes across London. There will be leisurely, easy to follow cycle routes across London for cyclists of all backgrounds and abilities, available in the TfL Cycle Sundays Club in Strava. Accessing the routes through Strava will enable riders to see the map in real time with directions, track their route length, see the route difficulty level, elevation levels and how busy the road is. Downloading Strava is free to use and joining the TfL Cycle Sundays club will enable people to connect with friends and other cyclists.

Hiring a Santander Cycle is easy and one of the most affordable ways to travel in the capital. The Day Pass allows unlimited journeys under 30 minutes all day from £3. Santander Cycles e-bikes will be available to members for an additional £1 per half hour with the new Day Pass. E-bikes are otherwise available for £3.30 per 30-minute ride for non-members and customers without a Day Pass, or a fare of £1 per 60 minutes for monthly and annual members.  Anyone can become a member by creating an account for free online or through the app. TfL is also on track to add an additional 1,400 new e-bikes to the scheme this summer, more than tripling the number available to hire and further expanding access to cycling for all.

Road danger and the fear of collisions are a major barrier to increasing cycling numbers. TfL encourages Londoners to cycle safely and London's boroughs have made significant progress in expanding London's network of high-quality Cycleways in recent years. London now has over 360km of strategic cycle routes across London, and during this financial year, TfL will continue to work with London's boroughs to deliver more Cycleways expanding the network to new areas. With £19.5m of investment already announced, this funding will complete Cycleways between Lea Bridge and Dalston, between Deptford and Deptford Creek and Hammersmith and Kensington Olympia. This funding will also progress design and delivery of Cycleways across Bexley, Harrow, Hounslow, Bromley and Redbridge.

The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said:

'I'm committed to enabling more Londoners to experience the joys of cycling in the capital. That's why I'm delighted to support Londoners who are new to cycling, or who haven't got their bike out of the shed in a while, to give it a try on Sundays. TfL is offering a range of cycling discounts and training, as well as highlighting leisure routes people can use in their local area. Those who don't have their own bike can hire one from the 800 Santander docking stations dotted around the capital and take advantage of the Day Pass, allowing unlimited journeys under 30 minutes from £3. I hope this exciting initiative encourages more Londoners to get out cycling, and incorporate active travel into their daily lives.'

Miranda Leedham, Head of Customer Marketing & Behaviour Change at TfL, said:

'We know how important it is to encourage Londoners of all backgrounds to make the most of the benefits of cycling, which is why we are delighted to be launching this exciting new programme.

'Cycling is not only brilliant for your physical and mental health, but also is a great way of getting around and seeing London. You don't even need your own bike to take part in Cycle Sundays. With around 800 Santander Cycles docking stations across London, you can start your Sunday by hiring a bike and exploring the city.  We hope that this new programme will enable more people from all backgrounds start cycling and exploring new parts of London.'

Mariam Draaijer, CEO of JoyRiders, said:

'Cycling in London has improved so much over the last few years. Cycle Sundays is the perfect scheme to discover some of the amazing routes London Cycle groups including JoyRiders created over the last few years.

'Discover them on your own or with friends and family and see for yourself how cycle friendly London actually is. If you don't feel confident enough just yet or don't know how to ride a bike look up joyriders or one of the other local groups who can help you.'

Sarah Javaid MBE, CEO of Cycle Sisters, said: 

'The Cycle Sisters team is thrilled to share our routes which explore lovely parts of London as part of the Cycle Sundays campaign. The routes were developed by Cycle Sisters' volunteer Ride Leaders and are used on our weekly group rides that help to make cycling more accessible to Muslim women.  Our beginner-friendly routes make cycling in London a fun and joyful experience to enjoy with family and friends and open up a whole world to discover by bike!'

Nick Barr, Head of Participation at British Cycling, said: 

'We are delighted to be involved with the TfL Cycle Sundays campaign in order to help deliver a shared vision to inspire more people in London to cycle for recreation, transport and sport. At British Cycling, we're always keen to promote cycling joy in safe and responsible environments, and the TfL Cycle Sundays campaign reflects our ethos, while also promoting some excellent cycling routes for all types of riders to enjoy.'

Brian Bell, Vice President of Global Communications and Social Impact at Strava, said: 

'TfL Cycle Sundays is a brilliant initiative providing opportunities for everyone to embrace and experience the benefits of exploring London through cycling. There are some beautiful routes to discover, and we are incredibly proud that our partnership with TfL through Strava Metro, the leading platform for active transportation data to make human-powered travel safe, accessible and efficient, has helped improve the capital's cycling infrastructure to make active transportation better. At Strava, our mission is to motivate people to live their best active life. With the launch of the TfL Cycle Sundays initiative, we are excited to see the joy of cycling celebrated and felt amongst the entire London community.'

TfL's updated Cycling Action Plan 2, published last year, highlights the fundamental role cycling plays in making a greener, more progressive, modern city. The plan outlines why it is essential to broaden the appeal of cycling to a more diverse range of Londoners to ensure cycling levels continue to increase at pace and that all Londoners benefit from the health and economic benefits of cycling. TfL's research shows that people from under-represented groups are open to taking up cycling, but experience different barriers, and the plan outlines ambitious evidence-led measures to support these groups by addressing these barriers.

Londoners can take part in their first TfL Cycle Sundays ride at RideLondon's FreeCycle on Sunday 26 May. Ford RideLondon FreeCycle is the ultimate ride for cyclists of all ages, abilities and backgrounds. Set on a traffic-free route, the event is a unique opportunity to explore central London by bike, and it's completely free to take part. The event includes two Festival Zones at Aldwych and St Paul's along with the RideLondon HUB at Trafalgar Square, where riders can stop for mechanical help, food and drink and enjoy activities such as music and games.

Throughout this trial, TfL has partnered with OpenTable to offer dining deals at a wide range of restaurants, alongside other attractions
Data from trial will be used inform future decision-making and other potential innovative approaches to fares
Transport for London (TfL) is reminding people that an innovative three-month trial of off-peak fares on Fridays will end this week (31 May 2024).

Since 8 March 2024, Tube and rail fares on pay as you go with contactless and Oyster have been off-peak all day on Fridays, with millions of Tube and rail customers across London and parts of the south east benefiting from the trial.

Peak fares ordinarily apply between 06:30 and 09:30 and between 16:00 and 19:00 on both TfL and National Rail services. Making journeys on Fridays off-peak all day has made it cheaper for people to travel into London, with the aim of supporting economic growth by encouraging more people back onto public transport and into the office, and the city, on a day that has been quieter than other weekdays.

During the trial, the daily cap on contactless and Oyster has been amended to cap fares at an off-peak rate on Fridays, helping those who make multiple journeys through the day save even more. The trial has also seen 60+ London Oyster photocard and Older Persons' Freedom Passes able to be used on TfL and National Rail services before 9am, helping Londoners with these passes to travel for free all day on Fridays.

After the end of the trial, TfL will use a combination of public transport ridership data, research into customer perceptions, and feedback from the business community to evaluate the cumulative impact of implementing off-peak fares on Friday. This will then be used to inform future decision-making or other potential innovative approaches to fares across London.

Alex Williams, Chief Customer and Strategy Officer at TfL said: ""London is an amazing place to live, work and socialise, and this trial has looked to make it easier for people to travel into and around London on a Friday. Analysis of the trial is ongoing, and will help us to better understand how targeted initiatives like this could help encourage more people back onto public transport and into the London on a day that is currently quieter than midweek days.""

Throughout the trial, TfL and VisitLondon.com have been working with local businesses across London and key stakeholders to help promote a range of activities to further encourage people to make the most of their Fridays. OpenTable, a global leader in restaurant tech, are headline partner for TfL's off-peak Friday fares trial and is a central destination for Londoners looking to discover special menus and deals across a range of restaurants in the city. More than 120 restaurants, located all across London, are offering deals via www.opentable.co.uk/Fridays, including a Two-course set menu at Bill's Restaurant and Bar across London (excluding Victoria), with a free drink, for only £17.50

Further deals can also be found at www.tfl.gov.uk/deals - including 15 per cent off pre-booked tickets for the IFS Cloud Cable Car during off-peak Fridays by using code ""FRIDAY15"" on the TfL website. London & Partners, London's business growth and destination agency, has also created a new webpage - https://www.visitlondon.com/fridays - where Londoners can see a range of exciting offers from restaurants, museums, theatres and landmark attractions available on Fridays during the trial, subject to availability, to encourage Londoners back into the city.

Despite this significant progress, TfL and the Mayor remain committed to doing more, with continued action needed to achieve the Mayor's Vision Zero goal of eliminating death and serious injury from the transport network   
Vulnerable road users continue to be most at risk, with 2981 people walking, cycling and motorcycling making up 80 per cent of all people killed or seriously injured in 2023  
Transport for London (TfL) has published annual casualty statistics that show the number of people tragically killed or seriously injured on London's roads in 2023 fell by 6 per cent, from 3,974 to 3,709, the lowest level on record outside of the pandemic affected years. Last year was the lowest year on record for fatalities, excluding 2021, which was heavily affected by pandemic-related lockdowns and changes in travel patterns. This marks important progress towards the Mayor's Vision Zero goal of eliminating death and serious injury from London's streets by 2041. The number of people killed and seriously injured on London's roads has also reduced overall by 24 per cent against the 2010-2014 baseline [1].

However, 95 people were tragically killed on London's roads, with devastating consequences for the families, friends and communities impacted by these deaths and life-changing injuries. Collective action is still needed and TfL remains committed to working closely with London's boroughs, the police and other partners to carry out the work needed to achieve this goal.

People walking, cycling and motorcycling continue to be most at risk, with 2981 people killed or seriously injured making up 80 per cent of all people killed or seriously injured in 2023. The number of people killed while cycling has fallen by 40 per cent against the 2010-14 baseline, from 13 to eight. Data shows that cycling journeys have continued to increase with the number of daily cycle journeys increasing to 1.26 million in 2023, up by 6.3 per cent since 2022 from 1.18 million [2], suggesting that cycling trips have become safer overall. Concerns around safety remain one of the biggest barriers to cycling. To continue to reduce risk and increase the number of people who choose to cycle, there is a need to continue to introduce safe, segregated cycling infrastructure, lower speeds and road safety initiatives.

In 2023, there were 252 people seriously injured in collisions involving a TfL Bus, including passengers, and six people killed, which represents a 43 per cent reduction in bus involved fatalities from the 2010-2014 baseline [3]. While this progress is good, more is required and TfL is committed to improving bus safety. TfL continues to deliver its Bus Safety Programme, with all new buses joining the London bus fleet currently compliant with either the 2019 or 2021 Bus Safety Standard. As part of this, TfL has fitted 3,795 buses with Intelligent Speed Assistance, which ensures buses comply with the speed limit. TfL has also fitted 1,251 buses with an acoustic vehicle alerting system (AVAS), which alerts other road users to the presence of quieter electric buses and 1,297 buses have been fitted with a camera monitoring system that replaces wing mirrors to reduce blind spots and improve the driver's field of vision.

Cars continued to be the main vehicle type involved in collisions in 2023 and are involved in 68 per cent of all casualties on London's roads. Speeding remains one of the biggest risks to road users, with around half of the 2023 fatal collisions in London reporting speed as a contributory factor [4]. TfL continues to work on lowering speeds across London, and last year lowered the speed limit on selected roads in 14 boroughs, exceeding its target to lower the speed limit on 140km of roads by March 2024. There are now 264km of TfL roads are now subject to a 20mph speed limit. TfL is also working closely with the police to increase their capacity to take enforcement action against drivers and riders who speed, given the risk and harm it causes. The Met is currently on target to be able to take action on a million speeding offences by the end of 24/25. In 2023/24, more than 800,000 speeding offences were enforced [5].

TfL is working in partnership with the boroughs, police and other stakeholders to directly tackle road danger and continues to work on a number of major programmes to make London's roads and the vehicles using them safer. TfL's world-first Direct Vision Standard, which reduces lethal blind spots on lorries, is already helping to save lives and prevent life-changing injuries [6]. From October 2024, TfL will be enhancing DVS requirements with all HGVs over 12 tonnes required to have a three-star rating or fit Progressive Safe System measures to operate in Greater London. TfL has also continued to work on its Safer Junctions programme to make life-saving changes at some of the capital's most dangerous and intimidating junctions. TfL has so far completed work at 45 junctions across London as part of the programme, with works at Battersea Bridge and Lambeth Bridge due to start later this year.

Walking and Cycling Commissioner, Will Norman said: ""Every death or serious injury on our streets is devastating. We're making significant progress but we know there is more work to do to eliminate deaths and serious injuries from London's roads.

""The Mayor is committed to making it safer and easier for people to walk and cycle around our city, which is why we are expanding our safer speed programme, tightening the Direct Vision Safety standard for HGVs and working with the boroughs to deliver high-quality cycle routes as we work to build a greener, safer London for everyone."" 

Lilli Matson, TfL's Chief Safety, Health and Environment Officer said: ""It's encouraging to see that real progress is being made towards our Vision Zero goal of eliminating death and serious injury from the transport network. Last year saw the lowest number of road deaths in London on record, with the exception of 2021, which was heavily impacted by Covid restrictions.

""However, the latest casualty stats show that it is more important than ever to double down on our Vision Zero goal. Protecting everyone on the road, particularly people walking, cycling and motorcycling, is a priority for us and our partners and we will continue to incorporate our Vision Zero strategy into every decision we make. Without safe streets we know that people won't choose the most healthy and sustainable modes of transport. We are determined to make London a greener, more sustainable and safer city, and Vision Zero is an essential part of building a better London for everyone.""

Nick Simmons, CEO of RoadPeace said: ""It is encouraging to learn that there was a slight decrease in road deaths and serious injuries in London in 2023, but we are still deeply saddened by the tragic and unacceptable loss of life and the extreme suffering caused by collisions in the capital. The ripple effect of road crashes goes far beyond the statistics; it devastates families and shatters communities.

""So much more needs to be done to achieve Vision Zero, and road users must all take responsibility, no matter how they use London's roads. We need collective action and commitment from everyone - drivers, cyclists, pedestrians and policymakers - to see a significant reduction in road deaths and serious injuries and to create safer streets for all.""

TfL continues to work closely with boroughs across the capital to invest in the walking and cycling infrastructure needed to enable increases in active travel and keep people walking and cycling safe, and there has been significant progress in expanding London's network of high-quality Cycleways in recent years. London now has more than 360km of strategic cycle routes across London, and during this financial year, TfL will continue to work with London's boroughs to deliver more Cycleways expanding the network to new areas. With £19.5m of investment already announced, this funding will complete Cycleways between Lea Bridge and Dalston, between Deptford and Deptford Creek and Hammersmith and Kensington Olympia. This funding will also progress design and delivery of Cycleways across Bexley, Harrow, Hounslow, Bromley and Redbridge.

Last year, TfL launched its Vision Zero Inequalities Dashboard tool, creating a new map of London that shows the stark levels of road traffic injury inequality in the capital. The pioneering new tool is the first of its kind in Europe and shows how deprivation is linked to higher road casualty levels, reinforcing the need to target investment and improvements to protect those most vulnerable.

TfL will use the data from this dashboard to inform its own investment priorities and provide this data to boroughs to develop their Local Implementation Plans (LIPs). TfL has met and shared the findings of this dashboard with the boroughs with the top five highest casualty rates and top five highest casualty location rates.  TfL will continue to work with boroughs and stakeholders to analyse the cause of inequalities in road injury, help target future road danger reduction programme planning and investment for infrastructure schemes and drive further action to reduce road danger inequalities and make London's streets safer. The Mayor of London is committed to creating a fairer, more equal and integrated city as set out in the Healthy Streets approach within The Mayor's Transport Strategy. 

The Mayor of London's 2018 Action Plan for road safety and 2022 Progress Report set out measurable objectives that TfL, the boroughs, the Met and other partner organisations have been working to deliver. The time-bound actions in these plans have a deadline of the end of 2024 for completion, and the Mayor will ensure that these organisations continue to work together to achieve new, measurable actions by 2030.",0.3419734472293211,Thu,0.94,1.13,1.05,0.99,0.84,0.86,0.76,1,0.89,0.9721559268098647,0.9613874345549739,0.9978070175438596,0.9757391963608794,1.026315789473684,0.9893805309734512,0.9006381039197813,1.0416666666666667,1.0376681614349776,0.9942824471126357,0.9673202614379085,1.0140293637846656,0.996057104010877,1.0437798006068486,0.9966311817814311,0.8818502548020384,1.0466004583651642,1.0392056592516832

Imtiaz Dharker, co-director of Poems on the Underground will read her poem, 'Carving'
Six new poems will feature on the Tube, Overground and Elizabeth line by poets including Benjamin Zephaniah and Nii Ayikwei Parkes
Transport for London (TfL) brings live poetry readings to Covent Garden station on Monday 3 June, to mark six new poems to be featured on Underground, Overground and Elizabeth line trains this summer.

Writer and poet, Nii Ayikwei Parkes, will read his poem, 'By Yourself Boy… (1988-2007)' and Imtiaz Dharker, co-director of Poems on the Underground will read her poem, 'Carving' at 11:30 outside the front of the station.

Parkes' poem is one of six poems selected by Poems on the Underground for this summer:

By Yourself, Boy. . . (1988-2007)

Nat King Cole's on the TV staring hard at his audience,

his hands setting up plays while he sings.  Ray Charles

said he sang so damn well people forgot how good he was

on keys, and I see it now; his right hand stuffs a melody

down the grand piano's throat - that's the fake - he dribbles

the sound down to low notes until you expect the left hand

to come in lower. That's when he breaks mould, hustles

his left hand over the right, throws high notes into your ear

-crossover, up, swish. Now the trash talk it's better to be

by yourself boy… He smiles like the silent men on my tapes

and, suddenly, every move has a name, a sound, a history.

Nii Ayikwei Parkes

Later this month, trains on the Tube, Overground and Elizabeth line networks will feature a new selection of works with Poems on the Underground. The 117th collection of poems to be published explores themes of music and seasons - reflecting the diversity of human experience. A poem from the 13th century sits alongside more contemporary poems from Azita Ghahreman, Benjamin Zephaniah, and Don Paterson.

Mark Evers, TfL's Chief Customer Officer, said: 

'We know our customers love to read the poems featured on our trains, so these special live readings at Covent Garden station with leading poets will be a huge hit with visitors and commuters on the day. Poems on the Underground has been delighting and inspiring customers travelling for almost 40 years, and we hope our customers enjoy the latest set of poems launching on our network this summer.'

Poet Nii Ayikwei Parkes, said: 

'Having grown up in a West African culture that values community, it is always an unparalleled honour when my poems are chosen to be part of Poems on the Underground, especially because the Underground is such a pivotal means of transport in London, carrying thousands of locals and tourists daily. It tells me that my art has not lost its connection to the real world, and it gives me great comfort to know that someone's dull day might be brightened by looking up to read my work.'

Poet Imtiaz Dharker, said: 

'It was a great moment for me when my poem, 'Carving,' went up on the London Underground and now it's as exciting to see each new set of poems coming up, new work from living poets as well as old favourites. These Poems on the Underground give us a moment of stillness on a busy commute, something we need now more than ever. It still stops me in my tracks when I see them or see someone else reading one.

'It was such a brilliant idea from Judith Chernaik, Cicely Herbert and Gerard Benson and that's why it is still loved almost 40 years later.'

Poems on the Underground has delighted millions of commuters, tourists and Londoners since the first posters appeared on the London Underground in 1986. In February, the archive of Poems on the Underground, which includes posters, eclectic memorabilia and letters from poets over the past century, was donated to Cambridge University Library, home to the archives of Siegfried Sassoon, Anne Stevenson and other renowned poets.",0.16875774952358363,Fri,0.97,1.13,1.03,1.01,0.76,0.84,0.77,1.03,0.93,1.0031821797931584,0.9613874345549739,0.9788011695906432,0.9954510993176648,0.9285714285714286,0.9663716814159291,0.9124886052871468,1.0729166666666667,1.0843049327354262,1.0260148656375072,0.9673202614379085,0.9947145187601958,1.0161794697484705,0.9443722005490536,0.9734537124376769,0.893453547628381,1.0779984721161193,1.0859115315776016

This is why I am delighted that Santander Cycles will be offering unlimited free rides every Sunday in June, as part of Cycle Sundays. 

""As the weather gets warmer, this is perfect time to give cycling a try, for free, taking advantage of our growing network of cycleways, low traffic routes and off-road routes. This is just one of the ways the Mayor and TfL are working to build a better, fairer and greener London for everyone.' 

David Eddington, Head of Cycle Hire at TfL, said: ""TfL Cycle Sundays offers a range of leisure routes across London which are perfect for beginners looking to get into cycling. 

""Cycling is not only brilliant for your mental and physical health, but also a great way to explore and see more of London. We hope that enabling all Londoners to use Santander Cycles for free every Sunday will get more people out cycling, as well as giving them a chance to try out our brilliant bikes."" 

Road danger and the fear of collisions are a major barrier to increasing cycling numbers. TfL encourages Londoners to cycle safely and London's boroughs have made significant progress in expanding London's network of high-quality Cycleways in recent years.

TfL manages, optimises and controls Europe's largest traffic signal network of around 6,400 signal sites across the capital
London is moving towards an intelligent adaptive traffic signal system that enables optimisation of green time for all street users, including pedestrians, bicycles, buses and cars in a world first
The new system will deliver improved journey times, traffic flows and responses to incidents, as well as improved data on journey demand and road network patterns
Transport for London (TfL), working with Yunex Traffic Limited, has successfully transferred its ageing traffic signal system to the cloud-based Real Time Optimiser (RTO) system. This world-leading upgrade to London's road network management enables improved journey times, traffic flows and responses to incidents, as well as improved data on journey demand and road network patterns. This will help inform TfL's work to optimise the road network.

TfL manages around 6,400 automated traffic signal junctions and pedestrian crossings, one of Europe's largest traffic signal networks, which help to move traffic across both the TfL and borough road networks safely and efficiently. The RTO will transform the current traffic light control system that has been keeping London moving for more than 30 years. This will allow TfL to mitigate against the challenges of the complex, older road layout in the capital, providing resilience and future proofing its road network management.

Almost 4,000 junctions, 1,500 pedestrian crossings, and more than 16,000 traffic detectors across Greater London were seamlessly migrated to a new system without any impact on London's road network over a two-week period.

Traffic signals are central to the safety of Londoners on roads and are hugely important in helping TfL to run an efficient bus network. This infrastructure and its integration with RTO allows TfL's Control Centre to respond to incidents on the roads to ensure that all road users whether they be walking, cycling, using public transport or driving can travel safely. TfL's management of the road network is also central to its Vision Zero goal of eliminating deaths and serious injuries on the transport network.

The RTO also provides TfL with the platform to support the introduction of FUSION, a new intelligent adaptive control optimiser, which can replace the existing SCOOT system that has been operating across London for more than 30 years. This new system will be pivotal in improving air quality across the city, reducing congestion and helping traffic flow by using a wide range of modern data sources techniques.

Carl Eddleston, TfL's Director of Network Management and Resilience, said:  ""London's road network plays a vital role in enabling millions of journeys each day and we're determined to ensure that people can walk, cycle, take the bus and drive as safely and efficiently as possible. This world-leading new traffic management system will be a game-changer for us in London. It will use new data sources to better manage our road network, tackle congestion, reduce delay for people choosing healthier travel options and improve air quality.""

Wilke Reints, Managing Director of Yunex Traffic in the UK, said: ""We are delighted to be at the heart of this ground-breaking programme, having worked closely with TfL to develop this innovative solution for transport authorities both in the UK and internationally.

""Building on the UK's track record of developing modern traffic management and control solutions, RTO provides a robust, reliable system that will meet the needs of the world's largest cities, helping improve air quality, reduce congestion and make sustainable travel more appealing and accessible to everyone.""",0.2811594132885871,Fri,1,1.19,1.05,1.04,0.78,0.89,0.86,0.95,0.86,1.0248901903367498,1.001201923076923,0.9959349593495935,1.0139275766016713,0.9562171628721541,1.0383333333333333,1.0066889632107023,0.9837278106508877,0.9933993399339934,1.0577472841623785,1.0186823992133727,1.0140293637846656,1.0463630183548607,0.9692241005635024,1.0313973857970624,0.9978831830654645,0.994270435446906,1.0041762550072444
2024-06-20,Jun, TfL launches ten new Cycleways across London,"The new routes connect communities in areas including Stratford, New Cross, Barnet, Walthamstow and Ealing
 
 




 ""We are really pleased to see a network of Cycleways continuing to emerge across more of outer London and these are helping to unlock safer cycling for all Londoners""
 
 Helen Cansick
 TfL's Head of Healthy Streets Investment
 


 
The new Cycleways are enabling Londoners to travel more easily and safely around the capital 
These routes connect even more of London's communities contributing to the target of 40 per cent of Londoners living within 400m of a high-quality cycle network by 2030 
TfL has also published new user-friendly maps showing the local Cycleway networks, to help people plan their cycling journeys
Transport for London (TfL) has launched ten new Cycleways across London, designed to make cycling safer and easier around the capital. The new routes add another 35km to London's growing strategic cycle network.  

TfL and the boroughs' continued work to develop Cycleways in London means the strategic cycle network has more than quadrupled in size from 90km in 2016 to 390km in June 2024. Delivering high-quality new Cycleways will support Londoners of all backgrounds and abilities to cycle safely, encouraging greater diversity in cycling. 

The new Cycleways that further expand the network in London include: 

Cycleway - Folkestone Gardens to New Cross and Greenwich to Lewisham 

Two new links to Cycleway 10 (Waterloo to Greenwich) running through Lewisham, adding an additional 3km to the network 

Cycleway - Stratford to Woodgrange Park 

A new 3km link to Cycleway 2 (Aldgate to Stratford), through the east of Newham   

Cycleway 51 - Burnt Oak to Colindale 

The first Cycleway in Barnet, connecting two town centres 

Cycleway 60 - Chingford to Walthamstow via Ainslie Wood  

A new route which connects to Cycleway 24 (Tottenham Hale to Woodford New Road) and beyond to the comprehensive network of Cycleways in Waltham Forest  

Cycleway 61- Chingford to Walthamstow via Highams Park  

A new Cycleway connecting the Waltham Forest Cycleways to the north of the borough from Chingford to Walthamstow  

Cycleway 8 - Lambeth Bridge to Battersea  

An upgrade to this 3km route along Chelsea Embankment and Grosvenor Road and conversion to a Cycleway. This route connects to the Cycleway between Oval and Pimlico 

Cycleway 40 - Ealing to Greenford and Ealing to Brentford 

Two new links to Cycleway 40, running through Ealing and into Hounslow adding an additional 10km with a connection to Cycleway 9 (Brentford to Hammersmith)

Cycleway - Hanwell to Greenford

A new 3km Cycleway link from Uxbridge Road to Greenford connecting to Cycleway 40 (Greenford to Ealing) 

For the launch of the Cycleways, TfL has created new user-friendly maps that show where the routes are and how they connect to create local networks. This follows on from the recent launch of TfL Cycle Sundays, which offers a range of easy-to-follow leisure cycle routes and maps across London to explore the capital on Sundays. The campaign has been developed in collaboration with leading cycling organisations and aims to offer beginner friendly journeys for Londoners, backed up by a range of support to make it even easier to try out cycling for the first time, or after a break. 

TfL is making significant progress in transforming outer London for people walking and cycling. The completion of the new routes follow the recent completion of Cycleway 4 in March, which enables people to cycle safety from London Bridge to Greenwich. Further Cycleways are planned this year across outer London including the construction of two of the biggest Cycleways in London: Cycleway 9 (Hammersmith to Brentford) in Brentford and Cycleway 23 (Dalston to Lea Bridge) in Hackney. Both Cycleways are planned to be completed by late 2024. 

The most recent provisional safety data published earlier this month shows that the number of people injured while cycling dropped by 5.7 per cent from 2022 to 2023, while the number of daily cycle journeys increased by 6.3 per cent over the same period. 

Will Norman, London's Walking and Cycling Commissioner, said: ""Expanding London's cycleway network is key to enabling more Londoners to choose cycling as their mode of transport for shorter trips. These ten new routes connect communities in areas including Stratford, New Cross, Barnet, Walthamstow and Ealing and will support Londoners of all backgrounds and abilities to cycle safely as the Mayor builds a fairer, safer greener London for everyone"" 

Helen Cansick, TfL's Head of Healthy Streets Investment, said: ""We are really pleased to see a network of Cycleways continuing to emerge across more of outer London and these are helping to unlock safer cycling for all Londoners. These high-quality cycling networks bring a range of benefits to local communities and we are continuing to work closely with boroughs and invest in further active travel schemes. We look forward to connecting even more Londoners to our cycle network and make cycling more accessible to all."" 

TfL's updated Cycling Action Plan 2, published last year, highlights the fundamental role cycling plays in making a greener, more progressive, modern city. The plan outlines why it is essential to broaden the appeal of cycling to a more diverse range of Londoners to ensure cycling levels continue to increase at pace and that all Londoners benefit from the health and economic benefits of cycling. TfL's research shows that people from under-represented groups are open to taking up cycling, but experience different barriers, and the plan outlines ambitious evidence-led measures to support these groups by addressing these barriers.

2024-06-25,Jun, TfL delivers pledge of doubling wildflower verges in roadside areas to encourage more biodiversity,"Wildflower verges have doubled to the equivalent of 37 football pitches across the TfL's Road network with plans to expand in future years
 
 




 ""I am delighted that TfL have now delivered the equivalent of 37 football pitches of wildflower verges across London's road network""
 
 Seb Dance
 Deputy Mayor for Transport
 


 
Wildflower verges encourage biodiversity and helps wildflowers thrive, leading to greater amounts of carbon being stored in the soil, as well as supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies
The programme is a key part of TfL's Green Infrastructure and Biodiversity Plan, which sets out how London's strategic transport authority will seek to respond to the ecological crisis
Transport for London (TfL) pledged last year to increase biodiversity, mitigate climate change and become more sustainable in its operations by increasing the amount of wildflower verges on roadsides of TfL's network and has doubled the area managed in this way to more than 260,000m2 in 2024. 

The sites are managed to promote biodiversity by reducing mowing frequency to allow wildflowers to grow, TfL continue to regularly mow the edges to keep London's streets looking well maintained. TfL now has wildflower verges across its network including Gants Hill roundabout in Redbridge, Clockhouse roundabout in Feltham and the A21 Sevenoaks Road (Green Street Green) in Bromley. 

The flowers create a supply of nectar and other food resources, plus shelter, for wildlife including bees, butterflies, birds and small mammals. Wildflower verges bring additional benefits for London's biodiversity, including the transfer of carbon dioxide from the air into the soil and reduced carbon emissions from mowing. The new verges mean that there are now the equivalent of 37 football pitches of wildflower verges across the TfL road network.

The introduction of new wildflower verges formed a key part of TfL's commitment to enhance biodiversity across its estate. TfL's Green Infrastructure and Biodiversity Plan, published in March 2024, set out how TfL will protect, connect and enhance its green infrastructure and biodiversity and how it will work with other organisations to tackle this vital issue both now as well as part of longer-term planning. 

Lilli Matson, Chief Safety Health and Environment Officer at TfL, said: ""We are excited to expand biodiversity in London, making the capital greener and healthier. The new wildflower verges will encourage biodiversity and make London a more liveable and nature-rich city. We will continue to work with our partners to improve our network and reduce impacts of climate change."" 

Deputy Mayor for Transport, Seb Dance, said: ""I am delighted that TfL have now delivered the equivalent of 37 football pitches of wildflower verges across London's road network. 

""Protecting and encouraging biodiversity is essential to increasing sustainability and mitigating climate change, as we continue working together for a greener, fairer London for everyone.""

TfL has also recently completed work on Tolworth Roundabout, a scheme to help mitigate the impacts of climate change by creating over 6,000 sqm of Sustainable drainable systems (SuDS). TfL's rapid expansion of SuDS across London has resulted in exceeding TfL's green scorecard annual target of 5,000 sqm of SuDS each financial year. With the risk of flooding in London increasing year on year, London's existing network of sewers and drains is at capacity in many areas and the issue is exacerbated by a rapidly increasing population. TfL's work to create more SuDS in the capital, reduces the risk of flooding and improves London's river water quality.

The transport network will be busy with several other events also taking place in London and planned road closures over the weekend
TfL is one of the official partners of Pride in London and supports Pride month as part of providing a more LGBTQ+ inclusive network and workplace
A photographic portrait series at Vauxhall and Victoria stations honours volunteers including TfL staff and community groups for the theme 'Every Story Matters 2024: Spotlight on Volunteering'
Transport for London (TfL) is advising customers to check before they travel this weekend, as it gears up to celebrate the Pride in London Parade on Saturday 29 June.  

Central London will be busier than usual this weekend. The majority of TfL services will be running, but services and stations in central London will be particularly busy and people may need to queue before being able to board a train. Customers are advised to plan ahead, check before travelling and allow more time for journeys. Some bus routes in central London will also be on diversion or stopping short of their usual destination due to road closures. Oxford Circus Tube station may close at short notice on Friday 28 and Saturday 29 June due to industrial action. The Blackwall Tunnel will also be closed for southbound traffic over the weekend until 05:00 on Monday morning.

Parade participants should arrive at Bond Street, Hyde Park Corner or Marble Arch stations. Customers who wish to watch the parade or attend events at Trafalgar Square or in Soho are encouraged to arrive at Bond Street, Charing Cross, Embankment, Tottenham Court Road, Victoria or Westminster stations. Some stations may be exit-only, and this will be implemented as needed. 

TfL's theme for Pride this year is 'Every Story Matters 2024: Spotlight on Volunteering' to showcase the impact volunteering has on the LGBTQ+ community in London. TfL staff, along with seven grassroots LGBTQ+ groups including Pink Singers and Skate Gals & Pals, have been recognised for their work through a photographic portrait series, which is now on display at Vauxhall and Victoria Tube stations.

TfL has also worked with the London College of Fashion (LCF), UAL to develop a dress for the figurehead of the TfL float at the weekend's parade. LCF's BA (Hons) and MA Costume for Performance submitted designs and the winning concept, by Robert-Paul Dragota, an MA Costume for Performance alum will be revealed at the parade.

Emma Strain, TfL's Director of Customer, said: ""It's going to be a busy one this weekend and it will be really exciting to see everyone come together for the parade. We encourage people travelling around London, whether for Pride celebrations or to other destinations, to check before they travel. Pride is an important celebration for us and this year, for TfL, we're honouring the staff and community groups who put hard work and time into improving experiences for the LGBTQ+ community."" 

Earlier this year, TfL worked with Channel 5 to show how TfL operate behind-the-scenes on the transport network during major events such as Pride.

 Matthew Hill
 Assistant Director - Highways, Transport, and Regulatory Services at Kingston Council
 


 
Work also included a new shared foot and cycleway along Kingston Road and a new dedicated left turn lane to access the A3 and new developments from the Kingston Road
Sustainable ways of removing excess water will be a vital part of London's future resilience to climate change and flooding
Transport for London (TfL) has completed work on major improvements to Tolworth Roundabout. The scheme, which was partly funded by The Guinness Partnership and Lidl Ltd will deliver much-needed improvements to the roundabout, reducing congestion and protecting bus services against potential congestion from new developments in the area, as well as making it easier for people to walk and cycle.

More than 6,000 square metres of sustainable drainage systems (SuDS) have also been installed, partly funded by Thames Water, to help address flooding risks. SuDS are important to preventing the increasing risk of flooding by managing water runoff in a way that mimics natural processes, including through using extra vegetation and rain gardens, which are covered with plants rather than concrete, and permeable paving, which allows some water to percolate into the ground. This slows down the rate at which water enters the sewage system during periods of heavy rain, reducing the risk of flooding on the road network. The new drainage systems installed at Tolworth will not only reduce flooding risks but also help to improve water quality in the rivers and support the Mayor's aim for swimmable rivers in the capital by 2034. Installing more sustainable drainage is a key part of TfL's plans to make the capital more resilient and biodiverse and will be increasingly important in future years.  

Tolworth in southwest London is a busy district centre located next to the A3, which will see substantial growth over the coming years. The previous road layout experienced severe congestion at peak times, creating a poor environment for people walking, cycling and taking the bus. TfL has worked closely with the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames to understand the journey time impacts of the developments and what can be done to mitigate these. Bus journey times through the area were predicted to lengthen by 16-17 minutes due to the increased congestion from local developments. The changes will help prevent this journey time increase and also create more space for walking and cycling, making the transport network at this busy location healthier and more sustainable for everyone living here and moving through here.

The completed works create:

A new area for walking and cycling in the centre of Kingston Road, extending the existing ""Greenway"" in Tolworth Broadway. People walking and cycling will access the path from an existing crossing that connects through Tolworth Roundabout
A new dedicated left turn lane to access the A3 and new developments from the Kingston Road
Installation of pedestrian countdown timers on crossings
Footway renewal between the A3 roundabout and Tolworth rail station
New planting and landscaping on the roundabout and in front of Hollywood Bowl, Dean Court and Bell Court
Improved link for cyclists and pedestrians between Tolworth rail station and Tolworth town centre
An upgraded crossing at Donald Woods Gardens, giving people cycling a safer and more direct journey 
Helen Cansick, TfL's Head of Healthy Streets Investment, said: ""We are committed to making travelling by bus, bike and on foot more reliable and more enjoyable. Tolworth is a busy junction, and the work we have done means that it can now cope with a growth in people travelling around the area, as well as becoming a nicer place to live and work. We have worked hard to design a significant increase in sustainable drainage to protect from flooding and increase biodiversity, as well as contribute to the Mayor's aim to improve our river water quality."" 

Matthew Hill, Assistant Director - Highways, Transport, and Regulatory Services at Kingston Council says: ""We are very happy to see this scheme for Tolworth completed, particularly the improvements for our pedestrians and cyclists and the welcome new sustainable drainage system.  Schemes such as this are a vital contribution to our necessary future climate adaptation in response to the climate emergency."" ",0.2573187315526935,Thu,0.97,1.18,1.05,1.02,0.83,0.84,0.84,0.99,0.88,0.9941434846266471,0.9927884615384615,0.9959349593495935,0.9944289693593314,1.0175131348511384,0.98,0.983277591973244,1.025147928994083,1.0165016501650166,1.0260148656375072,1.010122042917462,1.0140293637846656,1.0262406526172672,1.0313538505996243,0.9734537124376769,0.9746765974127792,1.0361344537815127,1.0275291911702036
2024-07-03,Jul, First tunnelled section of Elizabeth line gets high speed mobile coverage,"Customers travelling on the Elizabeth line between Liverpool Street and Paddington now benefit from high speed 4G and 5G mobile coverage while travelling in the tunnels
 
 




 ""It's wonderful to see our programme to introduce high-speed mobile coverage now benefitting customers on the Elizabeth line, the newest part of London's historic underground network of stations and tunnels""
 
 Andy Lord
 London's Transport Commissioner
 


 
Further tunnelled sections to Whitechapel, Canary Wharf and Woolwich will be connected across the summer, building on all Elizabeth line stations getting mobile coverage earlier this year
Mobile coverage continues to be rolled out across the Underground network with Hyde Park Corner and Russell Square recently connected for the first time
High speed 4G and 5G mobile coverage is now available to customers using the Elizabeth line as they travel across central London.

Following all Elizabeth line stations getting mobile coverage earlier this year, TfL and Boldyn Networks, TfL's partner in delivering the connectivity, have now introduced coverage within the tunnels from the Royal Oak portal to the west of Paddington to Liverpool Street station, covering approximately five miles and meaning that they can now stay connected as they travel between stations. Further tunnelled sections of the Elizabeth line towards Whitechapel will be connected in the coming weeks, and the whole line will have mobile coverage by the end of summer.

TfL and Boldyn Networks are working to introduce high-speed 4G and 5G mobile coverage across the whole Tube, DLR and Elizabeth line network, as well as between Highbury and Islington and New Cross on the London Overground. Bringing high-speed mobile coverage to London's underground stations and tunnels means that customers can stay connected as they travel around London and share all the exciting things London has to offer with friends, family and work colleagues. All four mobile network operators - Three UK, EE, Vodafone, and Virgin Media O2 (VMO2) - are taking part in the rollout.

As well as providing mobile coverage to Elizabeth line tunnels, mobile connectivity also continues to be introduced across the Tube network in Central London. Recently, Hyde Park Corner and Russell Square stations on the Piccadilly line started to receive coverage and further sections of the Northern line, Bakerloo line, Piccadilly line and Victoria line are anticipated to go live in the coming month.

Along with allowing customers to stay connected with family and friends above ground, the expanding coverage will also give rail and Tube staff better connectivity to pass on information and host the new Emergency Services Network (ESN). The ESN, when fully operational, will give first responders immediate access to life-saving data, images and information in live situations and emergencies on the frontline.

As well as all eight 'underground' Elizabeth line stations, across London, 36 Tube stations have started to offer mobile coverage to customers in the ticket halls, platform areas and interchanges, with many more, including the southern end of the Northern line, expected to go live by the end of the summer. This is around 30 percent of Tube stations which are 'underground', and when combined with Tube stations which are above ground, means that nearly 70 per cent of all stations on the Tube network have now started to have mobile coverage available.

London's Transport Commissioner, Andy Lord, said: ""It's wonderful to see our programme to introduce high-speed mobile coverage now benefitting customers on the Elizabeth line, the newest part of London's historic underground network of stations and tunnels.

""This key step in bringing better connectivity to London's underground stations and tunnels will allow more people travelling around the capital to keep in touch, share photos and make the most of the city, especially as we start to enjoy the summer.""

Billy D'Arcy, CEO of UK & Ireland at Boldyn Networks said: ""Following the success of all underground Elizabeth line stations being connected, we're delighted that TfL customers are now starting to enjoy 4G and 5G coverage in the tunnels. This will benefit a huge number of passengers travelling between Liverpool Street and Paddington, including tourists travelling through central London this summer, as progress continues on the rollout of our new digital infrastructure for London.""

Amir Dawoodbhai, 23, and on the Executive Committee of TfL's  Youth Panel said: ""Young Londoners are already some of the most geographically mobile in the country thanks to extensive public transport here in the capital. Mobile coverage on the Elizabeth line and the Tube is a welcome addition to this offering. It enhances perceptions of safety, accessibility and general user-friendliness as young people start to experience London independently for the first time, helping to guide them through what can sometimes feel like a complex transport system.""

Mary McHarg, Union Affairs Officer at University College London and Chair of Trustee Board said: ""Getting signal on the Elizabeth line is a game changer. It will massively benefit students at UCL and across London, many of whom commute to campus each day. Most importantly, the ability to make calls and access the internet during journeys across London will help improve students' safety across the network.""

Michael Solomon Williams, Head of Campaigns at  Campaign for Better Transport said: ""This is great news for Elizabeth line passengers who will benefit from expanded mobile coverage. Extending coverage across London's underground network will make it much easier for people to keep connected and help passengers to navigate their sustainable journeys by Tube.""

The project is being implemented by Boldyn Networks, one of the world's leading shared infrastructure providers, who was awarded a 20-year concession by TfL in June 2021 to deliver high speed, 5G-ready mobile connectivity across the entire London Underground network. Boldyn Networks, formerly BAI Communications, is installing a fibre backbone across the capital to improve connectivity both above and below ground, bringing wide reaching socio-economic benefits to local businesses and communities.

Around 500 people are working overnight across the Tube network to install mobile equipment, with all works needed to be tidied away before the network opens for customers every morning. Once fully delivered, more than 2,000 kilometres of cabling as well as thousands of radios are expected to be installed within tunnels and stations, all of which will be fitted outside of operational hours.

2024-07-05,Jul, TfL announces weekend closures of southbound Blackwall Tunnel to support new Silvertown Tunnel,"Southbound closures of Blackwall Tunnel will take place across the weekends of 20-22 July and 17-19 August
 
 




 ""We are now in the final phase of works to complete the Silvertown Tunnel and these closures will help us to to start to get the tunnel ready to open""
 
 Nick Fairholme
 Director of Capital Delivery - Systems at TfL
 


 
Planned closures required to complete road layout to support the new Silvertown Tunnel which opens in 2025
Northbound traffic will not be affected by the closures and will be diverted via the southbound tunnel when required
Bus Route 108 will be temporarily split and terminate at Canning Town station and North Greenwich, with customers asked to use the Jubilee line to cross the river to complete their journeys with subsequent refunds available if required
Transport for London (TfL) has announced two weekend closures of the southbound Blackwall Tunnel, which are required to support the opening of the new Silvertown Tunnel in 2025.

The closures, which will take place across the weekends of 20-22 July and 17-19 August, will allow for the final road configuration to be implemented, as well as road resurfacing and safety barrier works to be carried out. These dates have been chosen to avoid key events happening in London during the summer.

Plans for the Silvertown Tunnel were first developed in 2012. When it opens in 2025, the new tunnel will help reduce traffic congestion and deliver faster, more reliable journeys in east London, making travel times up to 20 minutes quicker. There will also be a significant increase in bus services across the river and a proposed new cycle shuttle service through the tunnel for cyclists.

Across the weekends, the Blackwall Tunnel will be closed for southbound traffic and drivers will need to take alternative routes. Northbound traffic will not be affected by these closures as traffic will be diverted through the southbound Blackwall Tunnel when required. The weekend closures will start at 00:01 on the Saturday morning, with southbound traffic being restored by 05:00 on the Monday morning at the latest. Further information about the closures can be found at http://www.tfl.gov.uk/blackwall-tunnel

Drivers are advised to plan their routes in advance, checking before they travel so they can consider any other potential traffic impacts or restrictions, such as the height and weight limits at Rotherhithe Tunnel and Tower Bridge, both of which are outside the Congestion Charge zone. Roads and alternative river crossings in east and central London are expected to be extremely busy with traffic around Rotherhithe Tunnel and along the A13 Commercial Road between Canning Town and Whitechapel heavier than normal over the weekends due to the closures. The Woolwich Ferry, which now departs every fifteen minutes, seven days a week, will be in operation across the weekends. Where possible, people should consider using public transport or walking and cycling via other river crossings to complete their journey.

Drivers of HGVs, as well as vans more than two metres in height or weighing more than two tonnes, are advised to consider routes away from central London across the weekends where possible. To help inform drivers of the works, additional variable messaging signs will be placed on the main roads approaching the Blackwall Tunnel. TfL has also worked with third party app providers, such as Waze, to help ensure drivers who regularly use the Blackwall Tunnel are alerted to the southbound closure and that the closure is shown in any route-planning over the weekend.

TfL will also take the opportunity to carry out works within and around the Blackwall tunnel, to help deliver future maintenance work more efficiently and ensure the tunnel can continue to safely operate.

Nick Fairholme, Director of Capital Delivery - Systems at TfL, said: ""We are now in the final phase of works to complete the Silvertown Tunnel and these closures will help us to to start to get the tunnel ready to open. We appreciate that these planned weekend works will have an impact on some drivers and are doing everything we can to limit potential disruption - including ensuring a northbound route through the Blackwall Tunnel is maintained throughout.""

The route 108, the only bus route that operates through the Blackwall Tunnel, will be split in two, operating between both Lewisham and North Greenwich and between Canning Town and Stratford. Customers are advised to then change onto the Jubilee line to cross the river to complete their journeys. TfL will also ensure that customers of the route 108 who then use the Jubilee line as part of their journey over the weekend will avoid being charged for the Tube section of their journey via an automatic refund which will be processed after the weekend. The Mayor's Hopper fare will also mean that customers won't be charged for any additional bus journeys on the other side of the river, providing they begin within an hour of touching in on the first bus. From 00:01 on the Monday mornings of the closure, northbound buses will return to their normal route and southbound buses will be diverted via Tower Bridge until the tunnel is re-opened to southbound traffic.

Work on delivering the new Silvertown Tunnel, which will open in 2025, continues to progress well. Both of the 1.1km tunnels have now been fully tunnelled, with the 'cut and cover' sections now covered and safety critical equipment now being installed within the tunnels, as well as within the tunnel portals. Work is also progressing well on the new road layout around Tidal Basin Roundabout in Newham, including new walking and cycling paths to make it easier for people accessing the Royal Docks via the Lower Lea Crossing.

2024-07-10,Jul, TfL sets out consultation on user charge of Silvertown and Blackwall Tunnels,"The new Silvertown tunnel, first proposed in 2012, will help reduce congestion and deliver faster, more reliable journeys in east London, including new public transport and cycle connections, and help to improve air quality around Blackwall Tunnel
 
 




 ""Local residents and business owners currently face chronic congestion and pollution in the area around the Blackwall Tunnel""
 
 Sadiq Khan
 The Mayor of London
 


 
When the tunnel opens in 2025, user charges will apply at both the Blackwall and Silvertown  This has been planned since proposals for the new tunnel were first developed in 2012, to manage traffic and pay back construction costs
Exemptions would apply for taxis and blue badge holders, Zero-Emission Capable and wheelchair-accessible private hire vehicles registered with TfL and DVLA-registered minibuses and coaches, as well as staff and patients eligible for the NHS reimbursement scheme
To support residents and businesses, a green and fair package of concessions and discounts is proposed, including a 50 per cent charge discount for people on low incomes across east and south-east London and free cross-river bus, cycle shuttle and DLR travel for at least one year
The consultation on charge levels, including discounts and exemptions, will run until 3 September 2024
Transport for London (TfL) has today (Wednesday 10 July 2024) set out a green and fair package of concessions and discounts to support Londoners and businesses when the Silvertown tunnel opens in 2025.  

East London residents and businesses currently face chronic congestion in the area around the Blackwall Tunnel. The Victorian-era tunnel suffers from frequent closures - more than 700 times a year - which results in large tailbacks, poor air quality and millions of hours lost due to drivers being trapped in traffic. The new modern tunnel linking Silvertown in east London to the Greenwich Peninsula will reduce journey times and help manage air pollution. ​It will also support economic growth and allow TfL to increase the number of buses able to cross the river in this area from five to 21 buses an hour in each direction during the busiest times between 7am to 7pm Monday to Friday - all of which will be zero emission at the tailpipe.

Tunnel user charges - required as part of the development consent for the new tunnel and first proposed in 2012 - will be introduced for using the Silvertown and Blackwall Tunnels between 06:00 and 22:00, seven days a week once the new Silvertown Tunnel opens in spring 2025.

It is proposed that the standard off-peak rate of £1.50 for cars, motorbikes and small vans would apply the majority of the time for vehicles registered for TfL AutoPay. To manage traffic during the busiest times, peak charges will apply. It is proposed that peak charges will be £1 more than standard off-peak charges for motorbikes and an extra £2.50 for cars and small vans, and will apply for four hours northbound in the morning (from 06:00 to 10:00) and three hours southbound in the evening (from 16:00 to 19:00), Monday to Friday. 

During the eight-week consultation, Londoners will be able to comment on the proposed tunnel user charges, discounts and exemptions. This will enable TfL to ensure the user charge and range of discounts, both of which will be subject to the approval of the TfL Board, have been informed by feedback from the public. 

The proximity of the two tunnels has meant that, since the plans were first conceived, both need to be charged to ensure that traffic levels do not increase as a result of drivers seeking to use the uncharged crossing. 

To help residents and businesses, and to support people to use new public transport connections, TfL has proposed a package of green and fair measures - including a wide range of concessions and discounts. These include:

All buses, coaches and vehicles with nine seats or more registered with the DVLA would automatically be exempt from Silvertown and Blackwall Tunnel charges;

All taxis, blue badge holders, and wheelchair-accessible private hire vehicles registered with TfL would be exempt. 'Zero-Emission Capable' Private Hire Vehicles licensed by TfL - which currently make up at least 40 per cent of the 93,000 fleet - would also be exempt;

Tunnel charges would also be reimbursed to NHS staff and patients eligible through the NHS reimbursement scheme and vehicles registered under the Accredited Breakdown / Recovery vehicle discount would not have to pay a charge;

A 50 per cent discount would be available for low-income drivers in 12 east and south-east London boroughs and the City of London, as well as a £1 discount on the standard off-peak charge for at least one year for small businesses, sole traders and charities registered in Tower Hamlets, Newham and Greenwich;

Bus journeys made on three cross-river routes which start in Newham, Tower Hamlets and Greenwich, as well as cross-river journeys on the DLR from Cutty Sark to Island Gardens, and from Woolwich Arsenal to King George V will also be free for at least one year. This will support local residents and help encourage people to cross the Thames by public transport;

The previously announced 'cycle shuttle' service, which TfL consulted on in summer 2023, will allow people with bikes to safely cross the river via a high frequency bus service for cyclists around Silvertown and North Greenwich. This service would be free to use for at least the first year. More information about this is now available at haveyoursay.tfl.gov.uk/silvertown-cycling-service

The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan said: ""Local residents and business owners currently face chronic congestion and pollution in the area around the Blackwall Tunnel. When it opens in 2025, the long-planned new Silvertown tunnel will help deliver quicker, more reliable journeys in east London by easing congestion and making journeys up to 20 minutes faster.

""The Silvertown Tunnel scheme has been years in the making, first developed back 2012. Since I become Mayor in 2016, we have worked to improve it, adding discounts for low-income residents and local businesses, new bus services, a bespoke cycle shuttle service and free cross-river bus and DLR transport for at least the first year.  

""TfL is launching this consultation to get feedback from residents and businesses on the proposals. I encourage Londoners in the area to get involved and have their say.""

Christina Calderato, Director of Strategy at TfL, said: ""The Silvertown Tunnel is now less than a year away from opening and we are sharing our user charging scheme, so Londoners can have their say on the proposed charge levels and wide range of discounts and exemptions. Without introducing tunnel user charges for the Silvertown and Blackwall tunnels, there would likely be high levels of traffic and congestion, which would lead to detrimental air quality impacts, as well as longer journey times. 

""This proposed package of supporting measures aims to ensure the scheme is green and fair for Londoners and businesses. These measures will ensure that the new tunnel delivers on its objectives of reducing congestion and providing resilience at the Blackwall Tunnel, while ensuring we support local residents on low income, small businesses, sole traders and local charities.""

Along with the Silvertown Tunnel, work to extend the DLR from Gallions Reach to Thamesmead is being progressed. Following the opening of the Silvertown Tunnel, TfL will continue to look at options for additional river crossings in east London, including the potential for a new ferry for pedestrians and cyclists.

Land that was used for the construction of the Silvertown Tunnel in Newham will be re-used to support the regeneration of Royal Victoria and West Silvertown, as part of the Mayor's wider vision for the regeneration of the Royal Docks, including the building of more than 36,000 new homes and the creation of 55,000 new jobs  across this historic part of east London.

Work on the new Silvertown Tunnel is continuing apace, with construction work on the main tunnel now largely complete, and Tidal Basin Roundabout now almost fully reconfigured. Following good progress in recent months, the tunnel is expected to open in spring 2025, but important work is still required to ensure all the new safety systems within the tunnel are working, as well as completing landscaping and new walking and cycling routes near the tunnel portals.

2024-07-11,Jul, TfL sets out plans to improve safety at Hogarth Roundabout,"Proposed changes include creating a dedicated left turn lane for A4 westbound traffic onto the A316, where there is the highest concentration of collisions
 
 




 ""We're determined to improve road safety across the capital and these proposed changes will help reduce road danger at Hogarth Roundabout, particularly for motorcyclists""
 
 Penny Rees
 TfL's Head of Healthy Streets Investment
 


 
TfL also proposes to reduce the speed limit at the roundabout from 40mph to 30mph, and increase space for people walking and cycling
People encouraged to have their say on the plans, with consultation now open until 5 September 2024
TfL and the Mayor remain committed to the Vision Zero goal of eliminating death and serious injury from the transport network
Transport for London (TfL) is inviting people to have their say on major new plans to improve safety at Hogarth Roundabout, reducing road danger at this busy junction. The roundabout carries large amounts of traffic travelling to and from Chiswick, Richmond, Hammersmith, and Gunnersbury. However, the junction ranks in the top 10 per cent of junctions in London in terms of road safety risk. This is particularly important for people motorcycling, who were involved in six collisions at this junction between July 2020 and June 2023. There have also been two serious vehicle collisions.

Making the transport network safer for everyone is vital and forms a key part of the Mayor's Vision Zero goal of eliminating death and serious injury in the capital. TfL is proposing multiple changes to directly address the causes of collisions here, and make the roundabout more accessible for people in the area, including:

Creating a dedicated left turn lane for A4 westbound traffic onto the A316, where there is the highest concentration of collisions. This would mean closing one of the access points to Church Street. Access to Church Street would be via Chiswick Square
Lowering the speed limit at the roundabout from 40mph to 30mph
Increasing footway space on a service road for the A4 Great West Road (westbound) for people walking and providing new rain gardens to reduce the potential for flooding
Providing advanced stop lines for people cycling at all approaches to the roundabout
Adding Legible London wayfinding, to help people walking find their way around the area
Deep clean and lighting upgrades in the subway to help the area feel safer and more pleasant for people walking, as well as providing a seating area at the end of Church Street and additional cycle parking
The proposed changes will also make the area greener and help to reconnect the historic riverside area of Old Chiswick with Chiswick High Road.

TfL is asking people to have their say on the changes and a consultation is now open until 5 September 2024 at haveyoursay.tfl.gov.uk. Feedback from the public is hugely valuable to ensuring that the changes work for everyone.

Penny Rees, TfL's Head of Healthy Streets Investment, said: ""We're determined to improve road safety across the capital and these proposed changes will help reduce road danger at Hogarth Roundabout, particularly for motorcyclists. I'd encourage everyone to take part in our consultation and to have their say as people's feedback will be vital to ensuring the changes work for everyone. We look forward to collaborating with Hounslow Council on developing this scheme.""   

Will Norman, London's Walking & Cycling Commissioner, said: ""We're committed to making London's roads safer and more accessible for everyone, which is why we're proposing a dedicated left turn lane, and lowering the speed limit, in order to reduce collisions and increase safety at Hogarth Roundabout.

""We aim to meet the needs of all road users through this consultation process as we work to create a safer, greener London for everyone.""

 Marketing Director, Santander UK
 


 
TfL will more than triple the number of e-bikes in the scheme this summer, giving many more Londoners the opportunity to benefit from an affordable, convenient and sustainable way of travelling
TfL continues work on expanding the Cycleway network across the capital to make cycling more accessible to all Londoners
Transport for London (TfL) and Santander are making significant improvements to the Santander Cycles scheme by more than tripling the number available to hire and further expanding access to cycling for all by the end of summer. The e-bike fleet will reach a total of 2,000 bikes by the end of summer 2024.

The e-bikes have broken records this year, with more than one million hires made since they were introduced in 2022. The bikes are being hired at around twice the rate of a classic bike, highlighting their popularity. The new e-bikes will enable even more Londoners to enjoy the benefits that cycling can bring, from improved health to cleaner air. The new bikes also help to break down the barriers that stop some people from cycling, including fitness and journey length.  27 June saw the highest volume of e-bike users to date, with 3,584 hires, demonstrating the importance of expanding the fleet to ensure more people across the capital have access to the bikes.

E-bikes are available to registered users, for a fare of £3.30 per 30-minute ride or £1 per 60 minutes for monthly and annual members. The e-bike single ride price is cheaper than any other operator in London*. With the £3 Day Pass, e-bikes are available to hire for an additional fare of £1 per 30 minutes. Customers can use the Santander Cycles app to hire bikes and quickly see where all e-bikes are located across London. E-bike battery levels are also shown on the app.

TfL offered a free Day Pass on Sundays in June to celebrate the launch of TfL Cycle Sundays, a new programme of leisurely cycle routes designed to encourage more Londoners to get out and enjoy the capital by cycle. This gave customers unlimited 30 minute rides for free using a standard Santander cycle or £1 per ride if using an e-bike. The offer was redeemed more than 13,000 times by 5,586 unique customers and 64 per cent of the customers who redeemed it were new to Santander Cycles. TfL will be using the success of this promotion to look at further ways of attracting more customers to the scheme later this year.

The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said: ""Our Santander e-bikes are proving extremely popular with Londoners and so I'm delighted we're tripling our e-bike fleet this summer. These additional bikes will enable even more people to cycle for shorter journeys, helping build a better, fairer and greener London for everyone.""

David Eddington, TfL's Head of Cycle Hire, said: ""Santander Cycles is a vital part of London's transport system, and the scheme has gone from strength to strength, with cycle hire in the capital now an integral part of travel.

""These additional e-bikes will give more people in London an opportunity to try these brilliant bikes and use them more often. Santander Cycles has played an important role in encouraging more people to cycle and we'll continue to improve the scheme to ensure a greener and healthier future for everyone in London. We look forward to completing our expansion by the end of summer.""

Dan Sherwood, Marketing Director, Santander UK said: ""It's great to see the Santander Cycles scheme expanding once again. We couldn't be more proud to have been working with TfL since 2015 on this fantastic scheme and watching it go from strength to strength as an affordable, convenient and sustainable way of travelling the streets of London. The 900 additional e-bikes being introduced today will allow even more people to access and enjoy the scheme this Summer.""

TfL has recently created new cycle routes across London with user-friendly maps showing how they connect to create local networks. This follows on from the recent launch of TfL Cycle Sundays, which offers a range of easy-to-follow leisure cycle routes and maps across London to explore the capital on Sundays. The campaign has been developed in collaboration with leading cycling organisations and aims to offer beginner friendly journeys for Londoners, backed up by a range of support to make it even easier to try out cycling for the first time.

Road danger and the fear of collisions are a major barrier to increasing cycling numbers. TfL encourages Londoners to cycle safely and London's boroughs have made significant progress in expanding London's network of high-quality Cycleways in recent years. London now has over 390km of strategic cycle routes across London, and during this financial year, TfL will continue to work with London's boroughs to deliver more Cycleways, expanding the network to new areas. With £19.5m of investment already announced, this funding will complete Cycleways between Lea Bridge and Dalston, between Deptford and Deptford Creek and Hammersmith and Kensington Olympia. This funding will also progress design and delivery of Cycleways across Bexley, Harrow, Hounslow, Bromley and Redbridge.",0.33247333626556563,Fri,0.98,1.18,1.02,1.03,0.79,0.85,0.81,0.95,0.85,1.0184757505773672,1.0014144271570014,0.9797225186766275,1.0186813186813188,0.9647218453188603,0.9839228295819935,1.031117397454031,0.9850230414746544,0.9858247422680412,1.036592338479131,1.010122042917462,0.9850570962479608,1.036301835486064,0.9816500505707269,0.9850424471095539,0.9398667189337515,0.994270435446906,0.9924997869257649
2024-07-15,Jul, TfL and Hounslow Council set out plans to extend Cycleway 9,"Proposals to extend Cycleway 9 would make it easier for people to access local amenities and public transport, connecting Brentford town centre and key stations
 
 




 ""These plans will significantly improve walking and cycling between Brentford and Syon Park and represent a significant step towards making our streets safer and more accessible""
 
 Will Norman
 London's Walking & Cycling Commissioner
 


 
The changes would extend the existing C9 route by 850m, connecting communities between Syon Park and Hammersmith via a high-quality protected Cycleway
TfL is asking people to have their say on the plans, with consultation open until 9 September 2024
Safe, segregated cycleways vital as TfL and the Mayor remain committed to the Vision Zero goal of eliminating death and serious injury from the transport network
Transport for London (TfL) is inviting people to have their say on new plans to make it easier and safer for people to walk and cycle in and around Brentford. In collaboration with Hounslow Council, the plans would see the creation of a new, high quality, protected cycleway, to connect communities and cut road danger. This scheme builds on the success of Cycleway 9, which has seen increased numbers of people cycling in the area.

TfL's latest data shows that there has been a 56 per cent increase in cycling comparing Spring 2024 with Spring 2021. The proposal is part of a longer-term plan to connect the town centres of Brentford and Hounslow, to enable safer and more sustainable travel around the area. TfL analysis shows that west London is an area of high demand for active travel, where people want to be able to walk and cycle more often. TfL has undertaken traffic modelling in the area which suggests the proposals will have a low impact on travel times for people travelling by bus or motor vehicle. The proposed changes in the area include:

New protected cycle lanes in both directions along Brentford High Street between Alexandra Road and Beech Avenue.
New and improved pedestrian crossings along the route, making it easier for people to cross the street.
Changes at side-road junctions to slow traffic and give priority to people walking and cycling
Advanced stop lines to allow people cycling to get ahead of vehicles at the traffic lights
Changes to make the area feel more pleasant and help it adapt to climate change. TfL is working with the London Borough of Hounslow to identify potential space for trees, rain gardens, and sustainable drainage systems
Connection with Cycleway 40 linking to Old Isleworth and Twickenham
Changes to the layout of four bus stops
Will Norman, London's Walking & Cycling Commissioner, said: ""These plans will significantly improve walking and cycling between Brentford and Syon Park and represent a significant step towards making our streets safer and more accessible. By creating high-quality protected cycle lanes and enhancing pedestrian crossings, we are not only reducing road danger but also connecting communities to local amenities and public transport. I encourage everyone to share their views in the consultation and help us to shape a safer, greener, and more sustainable future for Hounslow.""

Helen Cansick, TfL's Head of Healthy Streets Investment, said: ""These improvements in west London would enable more people to safety walk and cycle in the area, giving the local community better sustainable and healthy travel options. We look forward to hearing from Londoners and invite their valuable feedback to shape the future of Hounslow before the consultation closes on Monday 9 September.""

Cllr Katherine Dunne, Hounslow Council's Cabinet Member for Climate, Environment and Transport, said: ""Hounslow Council is committed to providing a range of cleaner, healthier and safer travel options for our communities. Cycleway 9 is a great example of how we are working in partnership to achieve this. The message to all residents is that your input is vital in shaping the future of transport in our borough. Please join us on this journey and take a few minutes to view the proposals online and give us your views or attend one of the drop-in sessions at Digital Dock.""

More details about the proposals are on TfL's webpage, with interactive maps and options to give your thoughts on the project: https://haveyoursay.tfl.gov.uk/brentford-syon-park

There is also Easy Read and Audio versions of the proposals and survey as well as a British Sign Language video version and translated versions of the website.

The consultation period is open until Monday, 9 September 2024.

The consultation launch comes in time for the July opening of the latest section of Cycleway 9 East from Watermans Park to Brentford County Court. This section will complete C9 within Hounslow and open up a 6km route from the eastern end of Brentford to Hammersmith. The section is a valuable addition to the travel network which will play a vital role in ensuring people travelling in Hounslow can reach their destination safely and sustainably. This route will connect to Ealing, Hanwell and Greenford via Cycleway 40.

TfL's updated Cycling Action Plan 2, published last year, highlights the fundamental role cycling plays in making a greener, more progressive, modern city. The plan outlines why it is essential to broaden the appeal of cycling to a more diverse range of Londoners to ensure cycling levels continue to increase at pace and that all Londoners benefit from the health and economic benefits of cycling. TfL's research shows that people from under-represented groups are open to taking up cycling, but experience different barriers, and the plan outlines ambitious evidence-led measures to support these groups by addressing these barriers. ",0.3035794052415362,Mon,0.96,1.17,1.03,1.01,0.73,0.82,0.76,0.95,0.85,0.9976905311778291,0.9929278642149929,0.9893276414087514,0.9989010989010989,0.8914518317503392,0.9491961414790996,0.9674681753889675,0.9850230414746544,0.9858247422680412,1.0154373927958833,1.0015616866215513,0.9947145187601958,1.0161794697484705,0.9070943505273804,0.9502762430939226,0.8818502548020384,0.994270435446906,0.9924997869257649
2024-07-15,Jul, London-based artist Joe Namy introduces new community-led audio artwork at Waterloo Underground station,"New sound artwork by London-based artist Joe Namy launches today at Waterloo Underground station
 
 




 ""This project was a dream, a deep dive into the fascinating history of the sound of the Underground, at times offering moments of peace, at other times transforming the travelator into a catwalk, and other times making space for the brilliant organisations that contributed to the project""
 
 Joe Namy
 Artist
 


 
Spoken word from three London community organisations is layered with music in a 10-minute soundscape that can also be heard across the rest of the London Underground through a QR code
Namy worked on the project with the Mayor of London's Culture and Community Spaces at Risk programme, which works to protect community and cultural spaces across the capital
Transport for London's (TfL's) Art on the Underground programme is pleased to present a new sound artwork by London-based artist Joe Namy. The work has been developed following collaboration and community engagement with three organisations supported by the Mayor of London's Culture and Community Spaces at Risk programme.

Joe Namy works across sound, performance, radio and video. His new project, 'Radio Underground', involves creatives from different cultural and community spaces in London to create a 10-minute sound work, focusing on Namy's interest in the politics of listening, music and translation.

'Radio Underground' has been developed in collaboration with Colour Factory, a live music venue and nightclub in Hackney; PalMusic UK, a music education charity supporting young Palestinian musicians and celebrating Palestinian music; and Sister Midnight, a cooperative community radio station in south London. Spoken word and segments of speech from each organisation are layered with original music from flautist Wissam Boustany (PalMusic), oud player Saied Silbak (PalMusic), flautist Ruth Montgomery (Audiovisability), and theremin by Lenny Watson (Sister Midnight).

The work can be heard at Waterloo Underground station from 15-28 July, through the station speakers along the moving walkway connecting the Northern and Jubilee lines. Echoing the style of a radio broadcast, 'Radio Underground' brings a new sonic experience to the station, a public broadcast that calls on people to listen to each other in new ways, to new rhythms and to shared interconnections.

The work creates a space to find solidarity, and for culture and community to express resilience and an understanding of the socio-political power music holds. 'Radio Underground' can also be accessed through a QR code on a poster campaign across the London Underground, with a link to imagery that gives visual rhythm to the sound and constellation of the many parts, people, places and histories that make up the work.

Eleanor Pinfield, Head of Art on the Underground, said: ""We are delighted to launch the second in a series of sound commissions from Joe Namy, utilising the speakers of the moving walkway at Waterloo for the first time. 'Radio Underground' has been developed through dialogue and collaboration with three partners across the city, with contributions from each sonically woven together into an artwork akin to a radio broadcast. This soundscape for London calls us together in a collective space, one where we are well used to regular public announcements. Namy's audio soundtrack asks us to become more attuned to our surroundings, to take a moment to listen and share space with the people around us.""

Joe Namy, artist, said: ""This project was a dream, a deep dive into the fascinating history of the sound of the Underground, at times offering moments of peace, at other times transforming the travelator into a catwalk, and other times making space for the brilliant organisations that contributed to the project. We were able to bring in so many different voices to resonate with the unique architecture of the station."" 

Justine Simons OBE, Deputy Mayor for Culture and the Creative Industries, said: ""Culture is the beating heart of London and I know Joe Namy's 'Radio Underground' will entertain and inspire passengers as they travel on the Tube. I'm delighted that Art on the Underground is working closely with many grassroots arts organisations we have supported at City Hall, it's a wonderful opportunity to have their work displayed in one of London's busiest Tube stations, as we build a better and fairer London for all.""

About Art on the Underground

Art on the Underground invites artists to create projects for London's Underground that are seen by millions of people each day, changing the way people experience their city.

Incorporating a range of artistic media - from painting, installation, sculpture, digital and performance, to prints and custom Tube map covers - the programme produces critically acclaimed projects that are accessible to all, and which draw together London's diverse communities. Since its inception, Art on the Underground has presented commissions by UK-based and international artists including Jeremy Deller, Yayoi Kusama, Mark Wallinger, and Tania Bruguera, allowing the programme to remain at the forefront of contemporary debate on how art can shape public space.

Art on the Underground's annual audio commission series is developed as a strand of collaborative commissioning working with the Mayor of London's Culture and Community Spaces at Risk programme (CCSaR). Through engagement with the CCSaR programme and the communities around London Underground stations, the commissions aim to spotlight the work of organisations who face structural barriers to sustaining space in the capital and to create and share resonances from them, across the city.

Reed, the family-run recruitment and business services company, is the current annual sponsor for the Art on the Underground programme.

Joe Namy is an artist, composer, and educator often working collaboratively through the intersections of sound, video, performance, and sculpture. Their projects focus on the politics of music and organised sound, such as the pageantry and power of opera, the noise laws and gender dynamics of bass, the colours and tones of militarisation, the migration patterns of instruments and songs, and the complexities of translation in all this—from language to language, from score to sound, from drum to dance. Joe holds a monthly DJ residency called Rhythm x Rhythm on Radio Alhara, is the artist in residence for the London Borough of Barking & Dagenham, and a PhD researcher at the Ruskin School of Art at Oxford University.

The Mayor of London's Culture and Community Spaces at Risk programme (CCSaR) is a Greater London Authority programme focussed on safeguarding existing spaces across London - protecting both their social and economic value. The programme provides expertise to help protect against threats to London's cultural and community-led spaces, and directly supports organisations to save spaces at risk. The Mayor of London's Culture and Community Spaces at Risk programme (CCSaR) is working with Art on the Underground on this innovative new project which will feature some of the grassroots organisations the programme has supported. The project aims to amplify and make visible the work organisations do.

 Seb Dance
 Deputy Mayor for Transport
 


 
The six-part Mind the Gap podcast series sees the return of railway historian and broadcaster, Tim Dunn, who takes listeners on a journey to discover what inspired the new names for London Overground lines, starting with the story behind the Mildmay line, which runs from Richmond and Clapham Junction to Stratford
The Mind the Gap - Mildmay episode is now available to download, with episodes themed around the five other London Overground lines launching later in the summer
TfL has also launched a competition tasking Londoners to let us know how the new names inspire them through a poster illustration or a poem
Transport for London (TfL) has launched a new series of 'Mind the Gap' podcasts celebrating those who inspired the new names of the London Overground lines, as part of a series of activities this year to promote this historic change to the transport network. 

This autumn, for the first time, each of the six London Overground lines* will be represented by a new name and line colour to make it easier for customers to navigate London's transport network, while also celebrating the city's diverse culture and history. This significant change, which will include a major update to London's world-famous Tube map, was announced in February 2024 following engagement with customers, local communities, historians and industry experts.

The Mind the Gap - London Overground podcast series celebrates this change and follows on from the success of the 160-year anniversary of London Underground series last year. It is once again hosted by railway historian and broadcaster, Tim Dunn, also known for presenting 'Secrets of the London Underground' on UKTV's U&Yesterday channel. The series will consist of six podcasts dedicated to each London Overground line, delving into the meaning and importance behind each of the new names. The series starts with Mildmay, which runs between Richmond and Clapham Junction to Stratford.

For this episode, Tim Dunn visits three people who have a special relationship with Mildmay Hospital in east London. Mildmay is a small, charitable NHS foundation that was first set up in 1866 to support the cholera outbreak in east London. In 1988, Mildmay became Europe's first hospice to support and treat patients affected by AIDS. Along with the help of the late Princess Diana, who visited the hospital 17 times, Mildmay was able to help change the public perception of HIV/AIDS. Today the hospital still supports patients with HIV and AIDS, and also provides services and support for people who are homeless.

Tim meets with the CEO of Mildmay Hospital, Geoff Coleman, who discusses the history of the hospital and the work they are doing to support patients today. Tim then speaks with Beverley Nelson, social worker and safeguarding lead at the hospital. Beverley has been working at Mildmay for 14 years and she tells Tim about the family environment created at the hospital for both staff and patients, with a community-led approach. Finally, Tim speaks with former Mildmay patient, campaigner and AIDS survivor, Jason Reid, who tells his story of becoming seriously ill with AIDS in the early 2000s and the importance of Mildmay Hospital staff supporting him and helping him to survive during an incredibly difficult time mentally and physically.

Deputy Mayor for Transport, Seb Dance, said: ""This autumn, the London Overground lines will be given new names and colours in a historic and exciting change to capital's transport network, which reflect the heritage and diversity of our amazing city. I'm delighted Londoners will be able to learn more about this through TfL's podcast series Mind the Gap. I also encourage Londoners to get involved in TfL's competition and submit a poster illustration or a poem which describes how the new names inspire them.""

Emma Strain, Customer Director at Transport for London, said: ""We're launching a programme of activities throughout 2024 to celebrate the history of the six new names for the London Overground lines.

""Following the successful 'Mind the Gap"" podcast series last year, we're pleased to launch series two, which will be taking listeners on a journey to discover what inspired the new names for the London Overground lines. This is alongside an exciting competition for Londoners to design artwork for their local London Overground line, with many more activities and celebrations to follow in the coming months.""

Geoff Coleman, Chief Executive Officer at Mildmay Hospital, said: ""It is a real honour to be part of this next chapter in the story of London's transport system.  The journey of Mildmay Hospital is one that has touched the lives of so many. From the early years in the 1860s struggling to help families in the East End through the Cholera outbreak, right through to present day treating patients who have had to battle with HIV and AIDS. 

""During the COVID pandemic Mildmay stepped up to treat homeless patients transferred from hospitals across our capital city and that work continues today.  The naming of one of the London Overground lines is recognition of the wonderful work carried out by our doctors, nurses and many other clinical teams that are part of Mildmay and the wider NHS family over many generations.""

Tim Dunn, Railway Historian and Broadcaster, said: ""What a privilege we've had in meeting so many of the people who are key to the stories behind all the new line names of the London Overground! It's a true journey of discovery for me as it will be for many listeners - every line's story has opened my eyes and has given me a new way of looking at the city I call home.""

A programme of activities throughout 2024 will celebrate the rich history of the six new London Overground lines, including a competition for Londoners to let us know how the new names inspire them through a poster illustration or a poem. The competition is open until 30 August to anyone who lives in Greater London and Hertfordshire. TfL will pick one poster and one poem for each line that will feature on the London Overground network. The winners will be announced as part of the unveiling of the new London Overground network later in the year. Further details on the competition and how to enter the can be found on the Made by TfL blog.

Further episodes of the Mind the Gap London Overground series will delve into the origins of the Liberty, Lioness, Suffragette, Weaver and Windrush lines later this summer.

2024-07-16,Jul, Part closures on the A40 from Sunday to enable vital safety and maintenance work to take place,"Critical safety maintenance work will replace joints on slip roads to the Westway structures, between the Wood Lane and Marylebone flyovers
 
 




 ""We're determined to ensure a safe and well-maintained road network can play a full role in enabling Londoners to travel across the capital""
 
 Stuart Harvey
 TfL's Chief Officer
 


 
The work will require slip road and directional road closures from Sunday until mid-October
Though closures have been carefully planned to minimise disruption as much as possible, diversion routes are expected to be extremely busy
The road is one of the main routes into London and the work will ensure it remains safe and reliable for decades to come
Further phases of vital work are currently being planned for later this year and coming years
Transport for London (TfL) is reminding drivers and others travelling in west London of critical safety maintenance work on the A40 from 22:00 on Sunday 21 July. TfL is working closely with its partners to minimise disruption.

TfL is responsible for the safe operation and maintenance of London's network of red routes, including the A40 Westway — one of London's busiest roads, carrying around 90,000 vehicles a day. The structures which carry the Wood Lane flyover to the Marylebone flyover date back to 1969 and are reaching the end of their serviceable life, meaning that they require safety critical maintenance to ensure they remain safe and can continue to serve Londoners for decades to come.

From Sunday 21 July, TfL will be replacing four joints which provide support to slip roads to the A40, as part of an ongoing programme of improvement work to the road network in the area. Road closures are essential for this work to take place and have been timed to minimise disruption as much as possible, with the most impactful works undertaken during the summer holiday period, when traffic flows on red routes are up to seven per cent lower, with 20 per cent less traffic in central London.

This work will be undertaken in two separate phases:

From 22:00 on Sunday 21 July to Thursday 22 August 2024, the eastbound slip road from the Westway Roundabout and the A3220 West Cross Route southbound between the Westway Roundabout and the Holland Park Roundabout will be closed to all traffic
From Monday 2 September to mid-October 2024, the westbound on slip from the A3220 West Cross Route to the A40 Westway via the Westway Roundabout will be closed.  The A3220 West Cross Route from Holland Park Roundabout to the Westway Roundabout will also be closed to northbound traffic
TfL is advising people that the A40 on approach to Wood Lane, diversion routes and local roads are expected to be extremely busy and that people should plan ahead, using alternative routes or transport modes where possible.  Full travel advice is available on the TfL website at tfl.gov.uk/westway.

TfL is also working closely with partners across London to ensure all work taking place on the road network this summer is co-ordinated as effectively as possible. This includes rescheduling other major works wherever possible and co-ordinating closely with the freight industry to ensure awareness of the closures. Work will be paused during the Notting Hill Carnival as part of TfL's work to minimise disruption.

TfL will be putting a comprehensive traffic signal strategy in place to try and keep traffic moving as smoothly as possible. This will be continually reviewed as part of our ongoing management of the road network.

Stuart Harvey, TfL's Chief Capital Officer, said: ""We're determined to ensure a safe and well-maintained road network can play a full role in enabling Londoners to travel across the capital. These ageing 1960s structures are reaching the end of their serviceable life and road closures are essential if we are to ensure they can continue to serve Londoners for decades to come. We recognise that these closures will have a significant impact on people travelling in the area and are working hard to minimise disruption as much as possible, including by rescheduling other work and reviewing traffic signals. I'd like to thank people in the area for their patience and would encourage everyone to plan ahead for any journeys in the area.""

The removal of TfL's Government operational grant in 2017/18, followed by the pandemic and a prolonged lack of certainty over Government financial support, had a severe impact on the investment available for refurbishment and maintenance work on London's road network. This has created a backlog of billions of pounds of maintenance works, requiring many years of sustained investment to address and ensure that the road network remains in good order. While TfL still lacks certainty over capital funding beyond 2024/25, tough decisions and work to reduce costs at TfL have enabled it steadily increase investment over the coming years, including along the A40.",0.3042264388898735,Tue,0.95,1.19,1.04,1,0.81,0.86,0.82,0.96,0.85,0.9872979214780601,1.00990099009901,0.9989327641408752,0.989010989010989,0.989145183175034,0.9954983922829581,1.0438472418670437,0.9953917050691244,0.9858247422680412,1.0048599199542596,1.0186823992133727,1.0043719412724306,1.0061182868796736,1.0065019505851756,0.9966311817814311,0.951470011760094,1.0047364400305576,0.9924997869257649
2024-07-18,Jul, London’s Superloop express bus network celebrates one year anniversary,"Latest TfL data shows increasing demand for the Superloop express bus services, with average growth on all Superloop routes since June 2023 nine per cent higher than network average
 
 




 ""The Superloop is making a real difference improving public transport in Outer London, adding more than six million additional bus kilometres per year to the capital's bus network and linking stations, town centres, hospitals and transport hubs""
 
 Sadiq Khan
 Mayor of London
 


 
Ridership on the first Superloop route - the SL8 - has increased by 18 per cent between June 2023 and May 2024
The Superloop has circled the entire capital since March, with a further route launching when Silvertown Tunnel opens in 2025
The 138km loop connects key locations across outer London, adding more than six million kilometres per year to the capital's network
One year ago, Transport for London (TfL) launched the SL8, the very first route to carry the Superloop branding. New data shows the average increase in passengers on all Superloop corridors (including parallel routes) since the June 2023 baseline is 11 per cent, nine per cent higher than the network average. Increasing numbers of customers are seeing the benefits of the game-changing network of express bus services, with new Superloop services adding more than six million bus kilometres per year to the capital's network, above the four million originally forecast. The Superloop network connects people using it with 310 other bus routes, 49 rail stations and 23 rail lines, improving outer London's connectivity.

The SL8 route, which runs between Uxbridge and White City, was the first of four existing routes to be renumbered over the summer last year to provide customers with an instantly recognisable express bus service in outer London. The route has the highest average weekday demand of all Superloop routes as patronage increased by 18 per cent between June 2023 and May 2024. Improvements on the SL8 included a change to the timetable with improved frequencies and expanded operating hours to provide more early morning and evening services, as well as USB charging and new priority seating.

The Superloop network is helping to increase bus patronage around London. The SL7, which launched on 19 August 2023 and replaced the previous X26 route between West Croydon and Heathrow Airport, saw the largest increase in Superloop patronage between June 2023 and May 2024, with there being a 91 per cent increase in journeys as a result of the doubling in service frequency. Once the change in patronage on parallel routes was taken into account, corridor demand increased by 21 per cent. Patronage on the SL6 route from Russell Square to West Croydon also increased by 20 per cent in the same period. Furthermore, growth on the five most recent routes to launch, SL1, SL2, SL3, SL5 and SL10 was 16 per cent higher in May than June 2023 in terms of average weekday corridor demand.

Bus ridership continues to grow across the network with 1.86 billion bus journeys made in 2023/2024. More than 95 per cent of Londoners live within 400 metres of a bus stop, with buses being the most accessible, sustainable and affordable form of public transport. The Superloop connects town centres, hospitals, schools and transport hubs and other key locations across outer London. Early ridership figures show that almost half of all Superloop journeys involve an interchange with another mode of public transport, showing the important role it is already playing in outer London's connectivity. Alongside the daily cap, the Mayor's Hopper Fare means customers can take unlimited journeys within an hour for just £1.75, saving Londoners money on multi-route journeys, and encouraging more sustainable travel.

The final route in the new Superloop network, SL4, will begin operating between Canary Wharf and Grove Park once Silvertown Tunnel opens in 2025.

Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said: ""The Superloop is making a real difference improving public transport in Outer London, adding more than six million additional bus kilometres per year to the capital's bus network and linking stations, town centres, hospitals and transport hubs.

""This new data shows that if you build it, people will come and use it, and this is just the start. I have bold ambitions to deliver even more improvements to London's bus network, including Superloop 2 which would double the number of Superloop services and support my aim to build a fairer, greener London for all.""

Nick Owen, TfL's Director of Buses, said: ""It is encouraging to see customer demand continuing to grow in response to a new express service in outer London within its first year of inception. The data shows it's already transforming travel with millions of journeys each year. Initial feedback is looking very positive and proving popular with customers as many of the Superloop routes are still relatively new. Work is not done however, and we continue to review customer demand and feedback to make sure we are always adapting to customers' needs and making improvements where needed.""",0.29453489726057014,Thu,0.97,1.18,1.04,1.02,0.84,0.88,0.82,0.97,0.87,1.008083140877598,1.0014144271570014,0.9989327641408752,1.0087912087912088,1.0257801899592944,1.0186495176848873,1.0438472418670437,1.0057603686635945,1.009020618556701,1.0260148656375072,1.010122042917462,1.0043719412724306,1.0262406526172672,1.0437798006068486,1.0198086511251854,0.951470011760094,1.0152024446142094,1.015852723088724

£30m also available to deliver transformational bus infrastructure and operational improvements in three successful boroughs
London's 33 boroughs are responsible for around 95 per cent of streets across the capital and are vital partners in making them safe, accessible and reliable for all
Transport for London is making up to £50 million of funding available for boroughs to improve road safety on borough roads, as well as £30 million of funding to improve bus journey times and increase bus ridership. London's boroughs play a key role in the planning and delivery of schemes that transform local areas and support the Mayor's Vision Zero goal of eliminating death and serious injury from the transport network, as well as improving opportunities for safe and active travel in local communities. They also help ensure that the capital's bus service is comfortable and easy for all to use, offers attractive journey times and provides the connections people need.

This funding is in addition to the £80.4 million of Local Implementation Plan funding allocated to London's boroughs in 2024/25 and will help boroughs to continue their vital work making the capital's roads safer and more attractive for people using public transport, walking and cycling.

TfL is providing a fund of £50 million available to boroughs over the next three years to deliver significant safety improvements in their local area by reducing speeds and tackling the city's most dangerous roads and junctions. The fund will be open to projects between £0.5 million and £5 million. Examples of schemes TfL will consider funding through Borough Safer Streets include:

Projects that look to improve safety by reducing speeding and help to reduce the risk and severity of collisions
Projects that develop improvements to protect vulnerable road users and improve safety for people walking and cycling
Road safety improvements in high-risk locations
TfL is also providing £30 million in funding to a new programme called Better Bus Partnerships, which will make up to £10 million available for three successful boroughs to deliver transformational bus infrastructure and operational improvements. This includes new bus priority measures to improve journey times, better management of road works to reduce delays to buses, improvements to stops and stations to make it easier to change between buses and other modes of transport, and improvements to streets to make it easier to walk to bus stops and stations.

Penny Rees, TfL's Head of Healthy Streets Investment, said: ""We are delighted to announce two new funding opportunities available to boroughs to continue their vital work improving road safety and investing in bus priority and bus infrastructure. Working closely with London's boroughs is central to achieving a cleaner, greener and healthier London by reducing road danger, improving air quality and encouraging active travel. We look forward to working closely with the boroughs to deliver projects that make our city greener, safer and better for everyone.""",0.2583013326464847,Thu,0.97,1.18,1.04,1.02,0.84,0.88,0.82,0.97,0.87,1.008083140877598,1.0014144271570014,0.9989327641408752,1.0087912087912088,1.0257801899592944,1.0186495176848873,1.0438472418670437,1.0057603686635945,1.009020618556701,1.0260148656375072,1.010122042917462,1.0043719412724306,1.0262406526172672,1.0437798006068486,1.0198086511251854,0.951470011760094,1.0152024446142094,1.015852723088724
2024-07-22,Jul, 2024 grant applications open for community groups to further boost walking and cycling,"Applications are now open for Walking and Cycling Grants London until 9 September 2024

More than £565,000 is available to fund at least 60 walking, cycling and community ideas grants to increase participation among traditionally underrepresented groups
Enabling more people from all backgrounds to walk and cycle is vital to creating a healthier, more sustainable transport network 
Applications for TfL's Walking and Cycling Grants London programme, with more than £565,000 of grant funding available for community and not-for-profit groups that encourage people to walk and cycle. Each successful applicant will receive up to £8,000 over two years with an opportunity to extend their project for another year and receive an additional £2,000. Walking and Cycling Grants London (WCGL) aims to enable more people to walk and cycle, addressing the barriers that prevent people from getting active and helping to make London a more sustainable, inclusive, and healthy city. All projects give participants the chance to connect with their local communities, learn new skills, get active and improve their physical and mental health.

Funded by TfL in partnership with The London Marathon Foundation, and administered by Groundwork London, the programme offers two types of grants for applicants. Walking and Cycling Grants can provide successful candidates with up to £8,000 over two years with an opportunity to extend their project for a further year with an extra £2,000. Applicants will be considered on the potential of their idea to benefit the local community and boost walking and cycling levels, particularly among communities who do not tend to walk or cycle.

Applications for Community Ideas Grants are also open to help kickstart smaller projects across London that are based on previous successes in other communities. Potential applicants to the scheme will be able to browse successful former projects on the Community Ideas Hub, and then apply for funding of £5,000 for a single year to replicate these in their local community.

Applicants for both types of grant will be given help and support throughout the application process and further support will be given to successful groups during delivery of their projects.

Applications for both grants can be accessed at wcgl.london and the application window for both programmes is open until 17:00 on 9 September 2024. Successful applicants are set to be announced in November 2024. Applicants can visit wcgl.london to find out more about the programme or contact wcgl@groundwork.org.uk.

London's Walking and Cycling Commissioner Will Norman said: 

'Local community organisations can play a vital role in enabling more people to choose walking and cycle for shorter journeys, particularly from groups that have historically been under-represented. That's why I'm delighted that these groups will benefit from our walking and cycling grants, to help boost active travel in local communities and build a better, greener, more sustainable London for everyone.'

Miranda Leedham, Head of Customer Marketing and Behaviour Change at TfL, said:

'Breaking down the barriers that prevent people accessing the numerous benefits of walking and cycling is such an important part of making the capital a healthier and more sustainable city for all. We're so proud to see more than 78,000 participants benefit from our Walking and Cycling Grants funding and are excited to see even more Londoners of all ages and backgrounds get active with our brilliant funding scheme.'

Mike Diaper, Interim Group Director Funding and Impact, London Marathon Foundation said: 

'We are delighted to partner with Transport for London to fund the next round of Walking and Cycling Grants London. The programme has already inspired thousands of Londoners to get active, bringing together communities to walk and cycle. The fantastic projects that London Marathon Foundation and TfL have supported have helped to remove barriers to physical activity whilst encouraging environmentally friendly travel. We look forward to funding more groups to inspire activity for all, regardless of age, ability or background.'

Martin Petry, Grants Manager at Groundwork London said: 

'Groundwork London is thrilled to partner with TfL and London Marathon Foundation, supporting thousands of Londoners to walk and cycle more regularly and safely. This programme is so important, especially to those groups that are underrepresented or face barriers to participation. We are looking forward to supporting projects in 2024/25 to introduce the benefits of walking and cycling to even more people across the capital.'

To date the scheme has helped more than 78,000 participants in 33 London boroughs to benefit from walking and cycling, with activities including rides for children with disabilities, led rides for members of the LGBTQ+ community, classes learning how to cycle or repair bikes, or walks for people suffering from ill health or isolation. Last year, 88 new projects were awarded funding through the scheme bringing the total number of projects supported since 2016 to 338.

Those awarded funding last year included a project for residents across Redbridge to support LGBTQ+ people who live, work, socialise or study in the borough. The Redbridge Rainbow Community runs a project called ""Redbridge Rainbow on the Move!"" which focuses on people from the LGBTQ+ community coming together to explore their local area, increase confidence in walking, build social connections and improve participants' mental and physical wellbeing.

Other projects included Like2Bike, which oversees a broad range of cycling activities in Hackney schools, from learning to ride and on-road training through to race days in the Young Hackney cycling league. Alongside these, they also organise marshaled group rides to school known as 'bike buses', after-school leisure rides and a bike loan library to lend refurbished bikes, supplied by Westminster Wheels, to pupils who don't have one. The grant from WCGL enabled them to buy more bikes, helmets and locks, cover the cost of ride leaders and pay for the promotion of the bike buses. The bike bus has become more and more popular and on their June bike bus, 56 pupils and nine parents took part. The plan is for the bike bus to eventually become autonomous, marshalled by parents and the school.

Simon Shaw, Chief Executive, Redbridge Rainbow Community, said:

'We're really pleased that a diverse mix of LGBTQ+ people and allies are benefiting from our monthly walks. People have thoroughly enjoyed exploring local green spaces (for some it was their first visit!), enjoying some group exercise, connecting with others and the thematic activities we've included on the walks. It's been great that local partners have been able to lead some of the walks and activities, such as forest bathing and exploring local heritage, flora and fauna.'

Darren Reynolds, Project Manager at Like2Bike, said: 

'With the WCGL funding we were able to buy refurbished bikes, plus helmets and locks, and pay for a ride leader and marshal to oversee our morning bike buses and after school rideout clubs. The funding also allowed us to expand our loan bike library, giving pupils who don't own a bike the fun and freedom that comes from having one.'

TfL's updated Cycling Action Plan 2, published last year, highlights the fundamental role cycling plays in making a greener, more progressive, modern city. The plan outlines why it is essential to broaden the appeal of cycling to a more diverse range of Londoners to ensure cycling levels continue to increase at pace and that all Londoners benefit from the health and economic benefits of cycling. TfL's research shows that people from under-represented groups are open to taking up cycling, but experience different barriers, and the plan outlines ambitious evidence-led measures to support these groups by addressing these barriers.

TfL and London boroughs have more than quadrupled the size of the London-wide strategic cycle network, from 90km in 2016 to more than 390km in June 2024. Delivering high-quality new Cycleways will support Londoners of all backgrounds and abilities to cycle safely, encouraging greater diversity in cycling.",0.27310459199245907,Mon,0.98,1.22,1.06,1.03,0.77,0.87,0.74,0.95,0.85,1.0184757505773672,1.0353606789250354,1.0181430096051227,1.0186813186813188,0.9402985074626866,1.0070739549839227,0.942008486562942,0.9850230414746544,0.9858247422680412,1.036592338479131,1.0443634681011047,1.0236867862969006,1.036301835486064,0.956798150556278,1.008219916453308,0.8586436691493532,0.994270435446906,0.9924997869257649

Weekend part closures on the Piccadilly line in July and August will be followed by a 16-day part closure from Saturday 17 August to Sunday 1 September (Wood Green to Cockfosters and Rayners Lane to Uxbridge), with rail replacement buses available to help customers 
Work to be carried out includes renewing track, points and crossings in the Arnos Grove area, and work around Cockfosters Tube station, Cockfosters Depot and the Arnos Grove train sidings to prepare for the new Piccadilly line trains 
Piccadilly line customers are advised to plan ahead using TfL's real-time travel information tools including TfL Journey Planner and TfL Go, with detailed travel advice for customers available at: https://tfl.gov.uk/status-updates/major-works-and-events/piccadilly-line-upgrade
Transport for London (TfL) is advising Piccadilly line customers to plan ahead and allow more time for their journeys as a series of vital track and platform upgrades mean sections of the line will temporarily close this year. These upgrades are essential to ensure the line is ready for the first new Piccadilly line trains which will arrive in London later this year for testing, and then be introduced as a fleet of 94 new trains from 2025. 

The new trains are part of a £2.9bn investment to modernise the line, to help it run more reliably, safely, inclusively and sustainably. The scale of the upgrade, which will take place on one of London's deepest Tube lines with some of the oldest track and signaling infrastructure, means that a series of closures is required.

The longest of these is a 16-day planned part closure of the Piccadilly line (Wood Green to Cockfosters and Rayners Lane to Uxbridge) between Saturday 17 August and Sunday 1 September, with a reduced service expected on other parts of the Piccadilly line due to the unavailability of trains. Rail replacement buses will serve all stations between Wood Green and Cockfosters although customers travelling to central London may find it quicker to use local bus services to connect to nearby alternative Tube and rail stations. Customers who use Piccadilly line services to Uxbridge are advised to change at Rayners Lane for the Metropolitan line. 

For all of these part closures, Piccadilly line customers are advised to plan ahead by using TfL's real-time travel information tools including TfL Journey Planner and TfL Go, to check before travelling and to allow more time for their journeys. A dedicated travel advice webpage, which also lists the upcoming, confirmed weekend closures on the Piccadilly line so customers can plan ahead, is available on TfL's website, here: https://tfl.gov.uk/status-updates/major-works-and-events/piccadilly-line-upgrade

Stuart Harvey, Chief Capital Officer at TfL, said: ""I'd like to thank our customers for their patience while we carry out these essential upgrades to the Piccadilly line. The closures will help us prepare for the arrival of the fleet of 94 brand-new trains which will transform journeys on the line in the coming decades. Introducing a new fleet of trains is a huge engineering and logistical feat. Although much of the hard work goes on behind the scenes, there are times when we need to close sections of the railway to ensure that all existing infrastructure is compatible with the new trains. Closures of this type are scheduled to take place, where possible, in school holidays when demand on our network is significantly reduced."" 

Up to 80 per cent of the new Piccadilly line trains will be built in the UK at Siemens Mobility's new manufacturing facility in Goole, Yorkshire. The new trains will feature walk-through carriages, wider all-double doorways to help customers get on and off more easily, enhanced digital display screens for customer information, on-train CCTV cameras for additional customer security and will, for the first time on a Deep Tube train, provide air-conditioning. They will increase capacity by 10 per cent and will also improve energy efficiency and accessibility. 

Ahead of these closures, TfL will contact regular users of the Piccadilly line with travel advice and information. In addition, posters and public address announcements will be in place at all relevant stations.

2024-07-23,Jul, Historic Station Parade Clock in Southgate reinstalled,"The art deco wall clock facing Southgate Tube station was originally installed in 1933 and has since acted as a distinct landmark of the Southgate area
 
 




 ""After several months of work to carefully restore the art deco design, the clock is once again keeping time for the residents of Southgate and all our passengers using our Underground station and bus interchange""
 
 Gareth Leslie
 Customer Experience Manager at TfL
 


 
TfL commissioned repair works on the historic clock in 2023 to refurbish its dial, repair clock mechanism and replace missing features
Heritage of London Trust supported the repair works with a £7,000 grant and the work was undertaken by Cumbria Clock Company
The historic clock has been reinstalled at Southgate's Station Parade, following a restoration project carried out by Transport for London (TfL), Heritage of London Trust and the Cumbria Clock Company.

The art-deco style clock was installed opposite the Grade II* listed Southgate Tube Station in 1932-1933, as part of Charles Holden's design of Station Parade in Southgate. The renowned architect designed the wall clock as a concrete roundel with brass gilded ring plates and 12 gold button studs marking the hour.

After 90 years in service, the clock was temporarily removed in 2023 to allow for the important restoration works. Commissioned by TfL and undertaken by Cumbria Clock Company, these works included repairs to the clock mechanism, a refurbishment of the dial and a replacement of features that had gone missing over time, such as its gold medallions and sections of the chapter ring.

After being carefully repaired in a workshop in Penrith, Cumbria, the fully restored clock was reinstalled on Station Parade on the night of 4 July 2024. The restoration was supported by the Heritage of London Trust who awarded the project £7,000.

Southgate's Station Parade lies at the heart of Enfield Council's Southgate Circus Conservation Area and offers important transport connections to residents through its Tube and bus station. Southgate Tube station celebrated its 90th anniversary last year (2023) after opening in 1933 as part of the Piccadilly line extension. The station's architecture was influenced by Charles Holden's study tour of Northern Europe Architecture in 1930 and includes several notable architectural features such as bronze escalators and uplighters, as well as one of the few remaining passimeters on the Tube Network.

Gareth Leslie, Customer Experience Manager at TfL, said:

'Working with Heritage of London Trust and Cumbria Clock Company, we have restored an important part of Southgate's local history and architecture.  After several months of work to carefully restore the art deco design, the clock is once again keeping time for the residents of Southgate and all our passengers using our underground station and bus interchange. It's been a fantastic effort by all involved to bring this historic timepiece back to its best and we hope that it remains a local focal point for many years to come.'

Dr Nicola Stacey, Director of Heritage of London Trust, said: 

'We are thrilled to see Southgate's Station Parade Clock restored. As part of our Proud Places programme, local young people from The Pavilion alternative provision school had a chance to visit behind the scenes at Southgate Station, as well as follow the clock restoration project. It's been fantastic to have such enthusiasm in every direction.'

Jane Maggs, Vice Chair of Southgate District Civic Voice:

Heathrow Terminal 4 Underground station and the two other Tube stations serving the airport now regularly see more than one million entries and exits per month in total

An expansive new artwork by leading British artist and photographer, Joy Gregory has launched today at Heathrow Terminal 4 Underground station, transforming the ticket hall as part of Transport for London's (TfL's) Art on the Underground programme.

Renowned for her influence on British feminist photography and social justice movements since the 1980s, Joy Gregory uses photographic media to reilluminate overlooked narratives around identity, race, gender and social history, which underscore contemporary society.

A Taste of Home expands on Gregory's interest in themes of migration, memory and plant knowledge. Recognising Heathrow Airport as a gateway to London, a portal of entry and exit as people pass in and out of the city, Gregory has rooted this commission in dialogue with the community of refugees and asylum seekers currently living in temporary accommodation near the airport, many of whom are supported by the Hillingdon-based charity, Refugees in Effective and Active Partnership (REAP).

The artwork offers a space for the stories of newly arrived Londoners, displaced people whose realities are increasingly maligned and misrepresented, and explores how people carry a sense of home with them in the plants and food they cook, share and remember.

The artwork is installed on a series of 24 billboards in the Piccadilly line ticket hall rotunda of Heathrow Terminal 4 station. It brings together excerpts of a poem from the Poetry Translation Centre by Khaled Abdallah, 'Seeds in Flight', and Warsan Shire's poem 'Home'. These poetic fragments sit alongside ingredients which were discussed as 'tastes of home' during a series of photographic workshops Gregory facilitated in the temporary accommodation, and collaged over botanical artworks Gregory created using techniques such as cyanotype and monotype printing.

The 24 artworks expand on the photographic collage technique used for Gregory's 2023 pocket Tube map artwork A Little Slice of Paradise, which was inspired by TfL's history of staff-cultivated station gardens.

Rooted in solidarity, A Taste of Home mediates on the ways that compassion and food connect people, across oceans and beyond borders, and celebrates the cultures, languages and hopes which coalesce in London. The project marks the beginning of an ongoing creative relationship between Art on the Underground, REAP and refugees and asylum seekers living in the Heathrow area throughout 2024.

Joy Gregory, artist, said: ""I have long been fascinated by the journeys of food and plants, how they traverse continents and cultures, weaving stories of migration and resilience. Plants are central to our being, they sustain our bodies, heart, and soul. They embody the essence of human migration, reflecting our innate desire for new beginnings - sometimes chosen, but all too often, imposed by circumstances beyond our control. In the words of the poet, Warsan Shire, 'No one leaves home unless home is the mouth of a shark'. This poignant line encapsulates the harsh realities faced by those forced to flee their homes in search of safety and refuge. A Taste of Home is a project that honours the richness of diverse cultures and the shared humanity that binds us all.""

Eleanor Pinfield, Head of Art on the Underground, commented: ""The ticket hall rotunda at Heathrow Terminal 4 station is an expansive site at a symbolic location - the gateway to London for so many millions. Joy Gregory's new commission is an exploration of nature, food and plants in our city, exploring the histories and futures of both those who have lived in London for generations, and those newly arriving. Gregory's photographic installation will be a contemplative reflection of the city seen by thousands of people each day, rooted in the experiences of refugees and asylum seekers living in the Heathrow area.""

Justine Simons OBE, Deputy Mayor for Culture and the Creative Industries, said: ""London is one of the most diverse cities in the world, so it's a fitting tribute that Joy Gregory's A Taste of Home will welcome visitors and tourists as they arrive to the capital at Heathrow. The work uses plants to celebrate the communities that have settled in London and made their home, enriching our lives with food, culture and art.""

James Reed CBE, Chairman and Chief Executive of Reed, sponsor of Art of the Underground, said: ""Heathrow is a wonderful location to represent Joy Gregory's work which highlights elements of cultural diversity in our city. Reed began just around the corner in Hounslow and still supports local communities and those looking for work in the area, so this exploration feels meaningful for me for many reasons. I hope all those passing through Heathrow enjoy this installation as much as I will.""

As ridership continues to return to pre-pandemic levels across the TfL network, the three London Underground stations serving Heathrow Airport are now regularly seeing a combined total of more than one million entries and exits each month.

TfL recently celebrated the second anniversary of the Elizabeth line, which also calls at Terminal 4. By May this year the line had seen more than 350 million journeys since its 2022 opening. ",0.2234805759717699,Thu,0.94,1.14,1.04,0.99,0.94,0.92,0.74,1.01,0.9,0.976905311778291,0.9674681753889675,0.9989327641408752,0.9791208791208792,1.1478968792401627,1.064951768488746,0.942008486562942,1.0472350230414746,1.0438144329896908,0.9942824471126357,0.9758806177338192,1.0043719412724306,0.996057104010877,1.1680393006790926,1.0661635898126938,0.8586436691493532,1.057066462948816,1.0508821273331628
2024-07-25,Jul, A summer at the circus is underway at the IFS Cloud Cable Car,"The IFS Cloud Cable Car has been transformed with a circus theme for the school summer holidays, working in partnership with new operator FirstGroup

Aimed at children to keep them engaged while queuing, jugglers and acrobats will perform, alongside hula hoop and balloon making workshops
FirstGroup's contract to operate the IFS Cloud Cable Car commenced on 28 June
Over the school summer holidays, customers at the IFS Cloud Cable Car will be welcomed by circus-themed decorations and an array of circus entertainers while they engage in one of Britain's favourite pastimes, queuing. Jugglers, acrobats, and other circus acts will be entertaining customers throughout the summer before they board the Cable Car's iconic gondolas, which link the Greenwich Peninsula with the Royal Docks area on the north bank of the River Thames.

From 29 July to 1 September, afternoon performances for customers in the queue will take place on Mondays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. Alongside queue entertainers, customers can also expect to be welcomed with circus themed music, workshops on hula hoops and balloon making, candyfloss and popcorn carts, and photo opportunities with circus themed decorations. All of the entertainment is free and targeted especially at children to help keep them engaged and excited before their journeys. The Cable Car mascot, Engie Bear, will also be present every day throughout the summer to support the fun and festivities.

Josh Crompton, TfL's Head of the IFS Cloud Cable Car, said: ""The school summer holidays is one the busiest times of the year for the Cable Car and we are very excited to launch this programme of events around the circus theme to bolster the experience for our customers as they wait in line for their journeys. We will of course continue to get our customers to the gondolas in good time, they'll just have a bit more fun in the lead up to them.""

The Cable Car is open 07:00 - 21:00 Monday - Thursday, 07:00 - 23:00 Friday, 08:00 - 23:00 Saturday, and 09:00 - 21:00 Sunday. With one-way journeys starting from just £6 for adults, £3 for children, and under-5s travelling for free, the Cable Car provides a unique day out for families, groups, couples, and individuals. Advance bookings can enable up to 30 per cent discount on tickets and groups of up to ten people can travel in their own private cabin at no extra charge.

More than ten years after opening, the IFS Cloud Cable Car continues to be a success with Londoners and visitors to the capital. Initially popular for journeys between London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games events at The O2 and ExCeL London, it is now a leading attraction in London and the UK as well as being a public transport mode, with increasing leisure and sightseeing trips, as well as being used for travel between the north and south of the River Thames. The proximity of the Cable Car to a multitude of hotels, restaurants, and services on both sides of the river opens the city up for people to explore both sides of the river.

There have been tens of millions of journeys made on the Cable Car since opening in 2012, supporting major regeneration in both the Royal Docks and Greenwich Peninsula. It links with the new Elizabeth line station at Custom House, just a short walk away for services towards Paddington or Abbey Wood, or with DLR services from Royal Victoria or Custom House for ExCeL London. The Cable Car also provides a direct route to the new City Hall based beside the north terminal in Newham.

Earlier this year, the contract to operate the IFS Cloud Cable Car was awarded to FirstGroup. The contract officially commenced on 28 June 2024 and has an initial core five-year term with the option for FirstGroup to extend for a further three years. Alongside day-to-day operations, over the life of the contract FirstGroup will also promote the Cable Car as a must visit leisure attraction in the UK and establish work placements for school students in the local boroughs of Greenwich and Newham as part of their educational outreach initiative.

Martijn Gilbert, Managing Director, Open Access, Tram & Cable, First Rail, said: ""We are delighted to have taken over the operations of the IFS Cloud Cable Car and are very pleased with the smooth transition so far. We are looking forward to working in partnership with TfL in its vision to promote the Cable Car as a leader in London's leisure market and deliver a number of improvements to the service. This circus promotion is a great example of an innovative idea to encourage more visitors to this iconic attraction.""",0.2023006695936314,Thu,0.94,1.14,1.04,0.99,0.94,0.92,0.74,1.01,0.9,0.976905311778291,0.9674681753889675,0.9989327641408752,0.9791208791208792,1.1478968792401627,1.064951768488746,0.942008486562942,1.0472350230414746,1.0438144329896908,0.9942824471126357,0.9758806177338192,1.0043719412724306,0.996057104010877,1.1680393006790926,1.0661635898126938,0.8586436691493532,1.057066462948816,1.0508821273331628

Transport for London (TfL) has released the newest episode of the 'Mind the Gap' podcast to showcase the story behind the new London Overground Lioness line. On the anniversary of the historic Euro 2022 final win, presenter Tim Dunn speaks with two of the stars from the team, Chloe Kelly and Leah Williamson, about the legacy of that day and the importance of the Lioness line.  

This is part two of a six-episode podcast series on the London Overground names, celebrating communities and stories that inspired the new names of the London Overground lines, as part of a series of activities this year to promote this historic change to the transport network. It follows episode one, which was about the Mildmay line (released on 16 July). The series so far has gained more than 10,000 listens and downloads. In the Lioness line episode, Tim travels to St George's Park National Football Centre, the base for all coaching and development work undertaken by the Football Association, to speak with Chloe Kelly and Leah Williamson. The two England stars talk about what the naming of the Lioness line means to them, the impact it will have on young girls getting into football, and the future of the women's game. 

Later in the episode, Tim travels to Wembley Stadium for a discussion with recent FA Grassroots Match Official of the Year, and TfL staff member, Surekha Griffiths. Surekha, who works as an Operational Strategy Officer at TfL, has a special connection to the Lioness line. She recently travelled to Wembley Stadium to have lunch with then England Men's First Team Manager, Gareth Southgate after winning the FA Grassroots Match Official of the Year award for 2023. Surekha speaks to Tim about her journey into refereeing, the support from her family, and how she hopes more women are inspired to get into football.  

The Lioness line runs from Watford Junction to Euston, via Wembley Central, the home of England's national stadium Wembley, where a winning goal from Chloe Kelly in Euro 2022 saw the Lionesses biggest triumph to date. This was the first major trophy won by any senior English national football team since England men's team won the World Cup at the old Wembley in 1966. 

Seb Dance, The Deputy Mayor for Transport, said: ""The Lionesses' victory in the Euros in 2022 showed the nation that we could dare to dream. Not only did Sarina Wiegman's team take home the first trophy for England since 1966, they also inspired the next generation of female footballers, sparking a step change in attitudes towards women's football all around the country.

""The Lioness line will commemorate their victory and its impact in a lasting way, while making it easier to navigate the Overground. I hope listeners enjoy this podcast featuring Chloe Kelly and Leah Williamson, as well as TfL's very own Surekha Griffiths, which gives us some insight into the journey of women's football and explains why the Watford-Euston line got its name.""

Claire Mann, Chief Operating Officer at TfL, said: ""We are proud to be introducing the Lioness line onto the London Overground network later this year to celebrate the achievements of the England women's national football team and to encourage girls of all age groups to become involved in sport. We are also extremely proud of our own staff member, Surekha, for her success in grassroots refereeing and we hope that her story will help inspire more young girls into participating in the sports they enjoy most."" 

Speaking on the Mind the Gap podcast, Lioness Chloe Kelly, said: ""The Lioness line shows that we are here to stay, we're not going anywhere. It's incredible to see how far the women's game has come, and now young girls are going to be jumping on that train going to watch games at Wembley Stadium. It really is a proud moment for us and hopefully we'll get to jump on the Lioness line and go watch a few games ourselves.""

Tim Dunn, Railway Historian and Broadcaster, said: ""Many people, me included, blocked football from our consciousness for decades. So we didn't see the rise of women's football: nor perhaps did we know its long history before. I hope this podcast inspires others to take another look - at a sport that they thought they understood.""

Surekha Griffiths, FA Grassroots Match Official of the Year, said: ""It was great to speak to Tim about my journey into grassroots football and to be celebrate the launch of the Lioness line, which I believe will help inspire more women and girls to continue to break down barriers in sport for generations to come.""

A programme of activities throughout 2024 will celebrate the rich history of the six new London Overground lines, including a competition to create a poster or poem for each line that will feature on the London Overground network later in the year. Further details on the competition and how to enter before the closing date on the 30 August can be found on the Made by TfL blog. 

This autumn, TfL will partner with the Regent's Park Girls League to create a special Lioness line football tournament for under 11s. The tournament will take place on the 14 September at Regent's Park to celebrate the launch of the London Overground Lioness line.

Further episodes of the Mind the Gap London Overground series will delve into the stories of the Liberty, Suffragette, Weaver and Windrush lines later this summer.

2024-08-02,Aug, Majority of respondents supportive of plans to extend the DLR,"Work will now progress to develop business case and further plans for the DLR extension to Beckton Riverside and Thamesmead
 
 




 ""It is great to see support to extend the DLR from Gallions Reach to Thamesmead via Beckton Riverside, which presents a crucial opportunity to boost connectivity by linking two major growth areas with two new accessible stations""

Extension would support low-carbon developments in Thamesmead and Beckton Riverside, unlocking the delivery of 25,000 - 30,000 new homes along the extended route

Investment in this scheme would also support a UK-wide supply chain, supporting growth and job creation across the country

TfL planning a future consultation for a bus transit scheme from Woolwich to Abbey Wood via Thamesmead

Transport for London (TfL) has published the consultation report on plans for a cross-river extension of the DLR from Gallions Reach to Thamesmead, via Beckton Riverside. With the majority of respondents supportive of the proposals. 58 per cent of respondents said the extension would make their journeys quicker around their local area and 75 per cent said it would make journeys into wider east and southeast London easier.

The consultation, launched earlier this year, received 1,254 responses from members of the public and 29 from a range of stakeholders including pan-London transport user groups, local businesses, environmental groups, politicians and adjacent boroughs.  In addition to the consultation, TfL ran sample polling in locations in Beckton, Gallions Reach, Thamesmead and Abbey Wood where 85 per cent supported or strongly supported the proposals.

The proposed DLR extension from Gallions Reach to Thamesmead via Beckton Riverside would connect two Opportunity Areas, key locations with potential for new homes, jobs and infrastructure, and four development sites.  This is one of a number of exciting opportunities to unlock the economic growth and housing developments the new Government is prioritising.

A new DLR station would be built at Beckton Riverside, with a tunnel built under the River Thames linked to another new DLR station at Thamesmead. It would build on experience from 2009 when the DLR was extended to Woolwich Arsenal, tunnelling beneath the River Thames, with housing growth following in areas including Woolwich, Canning Town, and the Royal Docks.

London's annual net contribution to the national economy is at a record £43.4bn. Investment in this scheme would support a UK-wide supply chain, supporting growth and job creation across the country. National Housing Federation analysis shows each new housing unit created at least one new job, so through this project we would create least as many jobs as housing units.

The DLR extension would also directly support the creation of up to 10,000 jobs, benefitting London and the national economy, and it would provide quicker journeys to other parts of east London like Stratford and the Isle of Dogs, with direct connections to central London via the Jubilee and Elizabeth lines, transforming housing, employment and leisure opportunities for the people who live in the area.

Alex Williams, TfL's Chief Customer and Strategy Officer, said: ""It is great to see support to extend the DLR from Gallions Reach to Thamesmead via Beckton Riverside, which presents a crucial opportunity to boost connectivity by linking two major growth areas with two new accessible stations.  

""We will now progress work on plans for the cross-river extension of the DLR, which could see customers benefit from the early 2030s, and continue to discuss funding options with all parties.""

TfL has been working together with the Royal Borough of Greenwich, the London Borough of Newham and the Greater London Authority (GLA), as well as landowners Peabody, Lendlease, abrdn, St William (Berkeley Homes) and Homes England to support the delivery of new homes, improved town centres and better access to jobs within and from Beckton Riverside and Thamesmead. This will only be possible by improving public transport connections. The partnership is also working closely with Government, demonstrating the importance of the project to the local and wider area. 

TfL and its partners submitted a Strategic Outline Case (SOC) to Government in 2023 outlining how an extension of the DLR could have a transformative effect on the area.  An interim Outline Business Case (OBC) will now be developed with this work anticipated to be completed in spring 2025.  The OBC will respond to Government feedback to the SOC and form the basis of future development and funding discussions.

The scheme is currently unfunded so part of this work includes developing a funding and financing strategy for the project, which would likely draw on funding from the private and public sectors, including TfL, local, regional and national sources. The aim is to agree an affordable solution by 2025, to enable construction to begin as early as 2028 and opening the DLR extension to customers in the early 2030s.

TfL also continues to discuss with Government its wider capital funding requirements and the link between transport investment, productivity and economic growth.

With significant growth pressures on London and the South East, transport and housing infrastructure must keep pace with demand. Forecasts suggest that London's population will have grown significantly by 2041, and that there will be at least an additional 800,000 jobs in the capital which will create the need for more housing.

Providing new public transport options like the DLR extension would support low-carbon developments in Thamesmead and Beckton Riverside, unlocking the delivery of 25,000-30,000 new homes along the extended route. It will also improve connectivity across the river and provide alternatives to private car use to lower future emissions and resulting pollution levels. 

Investment in this scheme would support a UK-wide supply chain, supporting growth and job creation across the country. The DLR extension would also directly support the creation of up to 10,000 jobs, benefitting London and the national economy, and it would provide quicker journeys to other parts of east London like Stratford and the Isle of Dogs, with direct connections to central London via the Jubilee and Elizabeth lines, transforming housing, employment and leisure opportunities for the people who live in the area.

The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said: ""I'm pleased to see public support for these plans to extend the DLR to Beckton Riverside and Thamesmead, which will unlock huge opportunities for London, support tens of thousands of new homes, deliver new transport connections, and boost the economy, supporting the creation of thousands of jobs. Enabling the infrastructure needed for the capital's growth is key to building a better, more prosperous London for everyone.""

Rokhsana Fiaz OBE, Mayor of Newham, said: "" I am delighted to see such strong community support for the proposed new DLR extension. The project has the potential to unlock a whole new development in the south of the borough, which would allow us to press ahead with plans to build more affordable homes, improve community spaces, as well as opening up the riverfront to all our residents.

""We will continue to apply our co-production model to ensure residents' voices are listened to and heard in all the important decisions we make to shape the future of the borough. So I welcome this vote of confidence in the extension plans and look forward to working with Newham residents and project partners as we take the next steps to make these plans a reality.""

Cllr Anthony Okereke, Leader of the Royal Borough of Greenwich, said: ""It is incredibly encouraging to see the support for extending the DLR to Beckton Riverside and Thamesmead. This is a clear mandate from the community that improved connectivity is essential to unlocking the full potential of the area. From new jobs to thousands of new homes, extending the DLR will not only transform Thamesmead, it will also make our whole area of London easier and more convenient for people to and from. We are excited to move forward with this project and build the case to deliver the positive change residents deserve.""",0.29196135370958237,Fri,0.96,1.13,1,1,0.76,0.87,0.74,1,0.9,1.0057142857142858,0.9818325434439178,0.9786476868327403,1.0018214936247722,0.9956331877729258,1.0155642023346303,1.0049382716049382,1.0119595216191353,1.0164271047227926,1.0154373927958833,0.9673202614379085,0.965742251223491,1.0061182868796736,0.9443722005490536,1.008219916453308,0.8586436691493532,1.0466004583651642,1.0508821273331628

 Cllr Jenny Yates
 Wandsworth Council's Cabinet Member for Transport
 


 
These stations join North Acton and West Hampstead, announced earlier this year
An additional seven Tube stations will be assessed for step-free access feasibility, including Colliers Wood and Tooting Broadway
Construction remains on schedule to start at Northolt station early next year
Transport for London (TfL) has today set out that work is getting underway on increasing the number of step-free stations on the London Underground network. TfL is starting design work imminently on making a further three Tube stations step-free, which means there are now five Underground stations with funding in place for this phase. A further seven Tube stations will undergo assessment for step-free access feasibility.

Work is starting on the designs that would make three Piccadilly line stations step-free (Alperton, Arnos Grove and Eastcote, which is also served by the Metropolitan line), building on feasibility work that started last year. 

This follows TfL confirming earlier this year that work was to start at Northolt Tube station on the Central line to make it step-free, and that design work will start at North Acton (Central line) and West Hampstead (Jubilee line).

A further seven Tube stations will also undergo assessment for step-free access feasibility; they are Croxley (Metropolitan line), East Finchley (Northern line), Neasden (Jubilee line), Northwood (Metropolitan line) and Turnham Green (District / Piccadilly lines), as well as Colliers Wood and Tooting Broadway on the Northern line.              

The feasibility studies at Colliers Wood and Tooting Broadway come after an initial assessment of stations on the southern end of the Northern line. TfL will examine benefits, costs, funding opportunities and impact on customers. The southern end of the Northern line is the longest stretch of the Tube network that does not have any step-free stations, with just the terminus station of Morden being step-free from street to train.

Today, more than a third of Underground stations across the city provide step-free access, with the Mayor of London's ambitious goal set at making 50 per cent of Tube stations step-free by 2030. Increasing the number of Underground stations with step-free access continues TfL's work to make the capital's transport network more accessible but progress will depend on deliverability and TfL's future funding position, with schemes prioritised where there is third party funding available.

The Deputy Mayor for Transport, Seb Dance, said: ""London is for everyone, and the Mayor and I are committed to making London's transport network as accessible as possible, to enable everyone to enjoy all that London has to offer. I'm pleased that work will begin soon to give three more stations step-free access, and I will continue to work with TfL to keep increasing this number, and build a better, fairer and more accessible London for everyone.""

Alex Williams, TfL's Chief Customer and Strategy Officer, said: ""More than a third of Underground stations across the capital are step-free and we're working hard to increase this number to help create a fairer, more accessible and inclusive transport network, opening up more of London to everyone. I'm really pleased that we're now able to confirm the next tranche of Tube stations that will be prioritised for step-free access planning, building on feasibility work that started last year and influenced by feedback from accessibility campaigners and TfL's consultation on step-free access.""

Councillor Krupa Sheth, Cabinet Member for Environment and Infrastructure at Brent Council, said: ""Our borough and the whole of London are for all to work, socialise and enjoy. So, I am delighted to hear of the progress towards more step-free access Tube stations on our network in Brent and across the capital. I look forward to the openings which will make our transport more accessible.""

Cllr Jenny Yates, Wandsworth Council's Cabinet Member for Transport, said: ""More than 11 million passenger journeys were made to and from Tooting Broadway last year, with typically 40 tube services an hour serving the station even outside peak travel times.

""Many of these journeys would have been made by passengers travelling to nearby St George's Hospital. A accessible lift at the station would enable many more people to travel to their appointments or visit families and friends by public transport. So, we welcome Tooting Broadway being considered for step-free access and are keen to see the results of the feasibility study from TfL.""

John McGeachy, Campaigns Manager for Age UK, said: ""Step-free stations have the potential to transform the daily lives of older and disabled Londoners, as well as many others. We really welcome the start of design work towards making three more stations step free, as well as news that more stations are to be assessed for their potential to be made step free. Increasing the number of step-free stations on the Underground network will make life easier for people that have faced too many barriers for too long.""

Step-free schemes at both Colindale and Leyton Tube stations are in progress, with Colindale station now closed until December 2024 while major upgrade work to give the station a larger ticket hall and make it step-free for the first time continues. Detailed design work is taking place at Leyton station, ahead of the construction contract being let later this year. Work continues with third parties to deliver step-free access at Knightsbridge and Paddington (Bakerloo line entrance) Tube stations.

2024-08-07,Aug, World-renowned artist Yayoi Kusama’s largest permanent public sculpture is unveiled,"Japanese artist, Yayoi Kusama uses her most recognisable motif, polka dots, as inspiration to create Infinite Accumulation, a soaring permanent sculpture at the UK's busiest station, London Liverpool Street
 
 




 ""Kusama is one of the world's leading artists and so it is fitting that this is the final work in a brilliant series of contemporary art commissions for the Elizabeth line""
 
 Justine Simons OBE
 Deputy Mayor for Culture and the Creative Industries 
 


 
The sculpture is designed to complement the architecture of the new Elizabeth line station entrance and surrounding area
The artwork was commissioned as part of The Crossrail Art Foundation's public art programme for the Elizabeth line with the support of Victoria Miro
Transport for London (TfL), British Land and City of London Corporation unveil a monumental new sculpture by internationally acclaimed artist Yayoi Kusama at Britain's busiest station, London Liverpool Street. Infinite Accumulation is the artist's first permanent public artwork in the UK and her largest ever public sculpture in the world.

Yayoi Kusama is best known for her use of massed, repeated polka dots, which first emerged in her work in the 1960s and have become one of her signature motifs. Polka dots cover the surfaces of numerous of her paintings, sculpture, and all-encompassing multi-media installations. For Kusama dots express both the underlying unity and instability of the cosmos, as well as Earth's often precarious place within it.

For this monumental site-specific work, Kusama has expanded the polka dot into linked forms which interact with and define the public spaces outside the new Elizabeth line entrance to Liverpool Street station. These dynamic serpentine arches were created intuitively by Kusama, hand-twisting the wires on the original models for the artwork.

Infinite Accumulation reaches over 10 meters high and 12 meters wide and covers an area of approximately 100 meters in length. Its gleaming silver spheres soar above the ground and are highly polished to reflect everything around them. This dynamic, highly reflective architectural form, mirroring the viewer and the world around it, means Infinite Accumulation responds to both individual and collective experience within the changing spaces of the urban landscape of London.

Infinite Accumulation was co-funded by British Land and the City of London Corporation. It is the final artwork to be installed and commissioned by the Crossrail Art Programme for the Elizabeth line, the largest collaborative public art commissioning process in a generation.

Kusama's work sits alongside works including Douglas Gordon's undergroundoverheard at Tottenham Court Road station and Chantal Joffe's A Sunday Afternoon in Whitechapel at Whitechapel station. It joins Manifold (Major Third) 5:4 by Conrad Shawcross, which was unveiled at the western entrance of the station at Moorgate in 2023. Infinite Accumulation is located outside the eastern entrance of the Elizabeth line at Liverpool Street station.

Yayoi Kusama said: 

'London is a massive metropolis with people of all cultures moving constantly. The spheres symbolise unique personalities while the supporting curvilinear lines allow us to imagine an underpinning social structure.' 

Justine Simons OBE, Deputy Mayor for Culture and the Creative Industries, said: 

'Commuters and visitors are in for a real treat when they arrive at Liverpool Street and are welcomed by Kusama's Infinite Accumulation. Kusama is one of the world's leading artists and so it is fitting that this is the final work in a brilliant series of contemporary art commissions for the Elizabeth line. The arts are a vital part of London's success, helping transform our spaces and connect our communities as we build a better London for all.'

Eleanor Pinfield, Head of Art on the Underground at TfL, said:

 'Infinite Accumulation is a monumental addition to public art in London and marks the first permanent installation of Yayoi Kusama's work in the UK. With this artwork, millions will enjoy the opportunity to encounter Kusama's dynamic and rhythmic sculpture, reflecting on the evolving city around them.'

Gareth Roberts, Head of Development - Science & Technology and Standalone Projects at British Land, and ex-Chair of City Property Association, said: 

'At British Land, we are delighted to see the installation of Kusama's work at Broadgate. This will be a fantastic addition to one of London's busiest areas, bringing joy and inspiration to the many people who pass through Liverpool Street Station each day.'

Chair of Crossrail Arts Foundation, Michael Cassidy, said: 

'Celebrating the vibrant tapestry of London's cultural mosaic, the City of London Corporation proudly supports Yayoi Kusama's sculpture, 'Infinite Accumulation' as part of the Crossrail Art Programme. We are privileged to fund this significant public art project, enhancing the urban landscape and inspiring reflection among visitors worldwide.'

Following the opening of the Elizabeth line, oversight of the Crossrail Art Programme artworks was transferred to TfL's Art on the Underground team. Located on its land, City of London Corporation will take on the long-term care of this artwork.  

A second public installation by Yayoi Kusama for London is presented by Serpentine and the Royal Parks in Kensington Gardens. Kusama's Pumpkin, 2024 takes the form of a large-scale bronze sculpture and is on view this summer. The work on view in Kensington Gardens is Kusama's tallest bronze pumpkin sculpture to date, standing at 6 metres tall and 5.5 metres in diameter. Installed prominently by the Round Pond, Pumpkin (2024) can be seen from a wide variety of viewpoints and perspectives creating an intriguing dialogue with the surrounding environment of the Park.

New data from the Office of Rail and Road ORR shows that the new Elizabeth line has dramatically increased the number of people using the central London stations. London Liverpool Street station, where Kusama's artwork is located, has now taken over from Waterloo as the busiest station in the country. 

People will be able to enjoy more artwork while travelling in London as six new artworks are set to launch on the Tube network this year as part of the Art on the Underground programme. This includes a series of artworks which are in place in the rotunda at Heathrow Terminal 4 Underground station by British artist and photographer Joy Gregory, a new sound work by Joe Namy with the Mayor of London's Culture and Community Spaces at Risk programme, which could be heard at Waterloo Underground station in July, and a permanent mosaic work at historic St James's Park station by artist duo Hannah Quinlan and Rosie Hastings, which will launch this autumn.",0.2675123733473096,Wed,0.93,1.13,1.02,0.97,0.78,0.83,0.68,0.95,0.85,0.9742857142857144,0.9818325434439178,0.9982206405693951,0.9717668488160291,1.0218340611353713,0.9688715953307392,0.9234567901234569,0.9613615455381784,0.959958932238193,0.9837049742710121,0.9673202614379085,0.9850570962479608,0.9759347382732835,0.9692241005635024,0.9618649777657997,0.7890239121912976,0.994270435446906,0.9924997869257649
2024-08-14,Aug, Work to deliver new Silvertown Tunnel moves closer to completion,"Southbound closure of Blackwall Tunnel will take place across the weekend of 7-9 September to further complete road layout to support the new Silvertown Tunnel which opens in 2025 
 
 




 ""We are now in the final phase of works to complete the Silvertown Tunnel and these closures will help us to start to get the tunnel ready to open""
 
 Nick Fairholme
 Director of Capital Delivery - Systems at TfL
 


 
Northbound traffic will not be affected by the closures and will be diverted via the southbound tunnel when required
Bus Route 108 will be temporarily split and terminate at Canning Town station and North Greenwich, with customers asked to use the Jubilee line to cross the river to complete their journeys with automatic refunds
Work on Tidal Basin Roundabout in Newham also nearing completion, with new walking and cycling routes due to open during September
A weekend closure of the southbound Blackwall Tunnel on the 7-9 September is required to support the opening of the new Silvertown Tunnel, Transport for London (TfL) has confirmed.

The closure is in addition to the planned southbound closure across the weekend of 17-19 August. This will allow for the final road configuration to be implemented, as well as road resurfacing and safety barrier works to be carried out. TfL will also take the opportunity to carry out works within and around the Blackwall Tunnel to help deliver future maintenance work more efficiently and ensure the tunnel can continue to safely operate.

Plans for the Silvertown Tunnel were first developed in 2012 to help address the chronic congestion east London residents and businesses currently face around the Blackwall Tunnel. The Victorian-era tunnel suffers from frequent closures - more than 700 times a year - which results in large tailbacks, poor air quality and millions of hours lost due to drivers being trapped in traffic. The new modern tunnel linking Silvertown in east London to the Greenwich Peninsula will reduce journey times and help manage air pollution. ​It will also support economic growth and allow TfL to increase the number of buses able to cross the river in this area from five to 21 buses an hour in each direction during the busiest times between 07:00 to 19:00 Monday to Friday - all of which will be zero emission at the tailpipe.

Across the weekends, the Blackwall Tunnel will be closed for southbound traffic and drivers will need to take alternative routes. Northbound traffic will not be affected by these closures as traffic will be diverted through the southbound Blackwall Tunnel when required. The weekend closures will start at 00:01 on the Saturday morning, with southbound traffic being restored by 05:00 on the Monday morning at the latest. Further information about the closures can be found at tfl.gov.uk/blackwall-tunnel.

Drivers are advised to plan their routes in advance, checking before they travel so they can consider any other potential traffic impacts or restrictions, such as the height and weight limits at Rotherhithe Tunnel and Tower Bridge, both of which are outside the Congestion Charge zone. Roads and alternative river crossings in east and central London are expected to be extremely busy with traffic around Rotherhithe Tunnel and along the A13 Commercial Road between Canning Town and Whitechapel heavier than normal over the weekends due to the closures. The Woolwich Ferry, which now departs every fifteen minutes, seven days a week, will be in operation across the weekends. Where possible, people should consider using public transport or walking and cycling via other river crossings to complete their journey.

Drivers of HGVs, as well as vans more than two metres in height or weighing more than two tonnes, are advised to consider routes away from central London across the weekends where possible. To help inform drivers of the works, additional variable messaging signs will be placed on the main roads approaching the Blackwall Tunnel. TfL has also worked with third party app providers, such as Waze, to help ensure drivers who regularly use the Blackwall Tunnel are alerted to the southbound closure and that the closure is shown in any route-planning over the weekend.

The route 108, the only bus route that operates through the Blackwall Tunnel, will be split in two, operating between both Lewisham and North Greenwich and between Canning Town and Stratford. Customers are advised to then change onto the Jubilee line to cross the river to complete their journeys. TfL will also ensure that customers of the route 108 who then use the Jubilee line as part of their journey over the weekend will avoid being charged for the Tube section of their journey via an automatic refund which will be processed after the weekend. The Mayor's Hopper fare will also mean that customers won't be charged for any additional bus journeys on the other side of the river, providing they begin within an hour of touching in on the first bus. From 00:01 on the Monday mornings of the closure, northbound buses will return to their normal route and southbound buses will be diverted via Tower Bridge until the tunnel is re-opened to southbound traffic.

Work on delivering the new Silvertown Tunnel, which will open in 2025, continues to progress well. Both of the 1.1km tunnels have been fully tunnelled and safety critical equipment now being installed. The final road surface is being installed within the tunnels and approach roads, which will allow for critical testing and assurance work to take place ahead of opening. Work is also nearing completion on the new road layout around Tidal Basin Roundabout in Newham. This roundabout has been redesigned to cater for the new tunnel, and by the end of September new walking and cycling paths around the route will be open to the public, making it easier for people accessing the Royal Docks via the Lower Lea Crossing.

Nick Fairholme, Director of Capital Delivery - Systems at TfL, said: 

'We are now in the final phase of works to complete the Silvertown Tunnel and these closures will help us to start to get the tunnel ready to open. We appreciate that these planned weekend works will have an impact on some drivers and are doing everything we can to limit potential disruption - including ensuring a northbound route through the Blackwall Tunnel is maintained throughout.'

TfL's public consultation on a green and fair package of concessions and discounts to support Londoners and businesses when the Silvertown tunnel opens in 2025 also remains open. The consultation, which closes on 3 September 2024, will enable TfL to ensure the user charge and range of discounts, both of which will be subject to the approval of the TfL Board, have been informed by feedback from the public.

Tunnel user charges - required as part of the development consent for the new tunnel and first proposed in 2012 - will be introduced for using the Silvertown and Blackwall Tunnels between 06:00 and 22:00, seven days a week once the new Silvertown Tunnel opens. The proximity of the two tunnels means that both need to be charged to ensure that traffic levels do not increase as a result of drivers seeking to use the uncharged crossing. It is proposed that the standard off-peak rate of £1.50 for cars, motorbikes and small vans would apply the majority of the time for vehicles registered for TfL AutoPay. To manage traffic during the busiest times, peak charges will apply. It is proposed that peak charges will be £1 more than standard off-peak charges for motorbikes and an extra £2.50 for cars and small vans, and will apply for four hours northbound in the morning (from 06:00 to 10:00) and three hours southbound in the evening (from 16:00 to 19:00), Monday to Friday.

To help residents and businesses, and to support people to use new public transport connections, a package of green and fair measures - including a wide range of concessions and discounts - is being proposed by TfL. These include reimbursement of tunnel charges for NHS staff and patients eligible through the NHS reimbursement scheme, a 50 per cent discount for low-income drivers in 12 east and south-east London boroughs and the City of London, as well as a £1 discount on the standard off-peak charge for at least one year for small businesses, sole traders and charities registered in Tower Hamlets, Newham and Greenwich.

Bus journeys made on three cross-river routes which start in Newham, Tower Hamlets and Greenwich, as well as cross-river journeys on the DLR from Cutty Sark to Island Gardens, and from Woolwich Arsenal to King George V will also be free for at least one year. This will support local residents and help encourage people to cross the Thames by public transport. The previously announced 'cycle shuttle' service, which TfL consulted on in Summer 2023, will allow people with bikes to safely cross the river via a high frequency bus service for cyclists around Silvertown and North Greenwich. This service would be free to use for at least the first year. The consultation can be viewed at tfl.gov.uk/TC-yourview.

On Sunday 8 September, 30 Londoners will have the chance to join two free weaving sessions at Chingford Community Hub to create a Weaver line roundel that will be displayed in one of the London Overground stations along the line
This autumn, for the first time, each of the six London Overground lines will be represented by a new name and colour to make it easier for customers to navigate the network, while also celebrating the city's diverse culture and history
The Weaver line is the new the name for the London Overground line that runs from Liverpool Street to Cheshunt, Enfield Town and Chingford
Transport for London (TfL) is celebrating the new name and colour for the London Overground line that will become the Weaver line this autumn, by inviting Londoners to take part in a free community weaving event in collaboration with Chingford Community Hub and Cockpit to create a Weaver line roundel for one of the stations along the route.

On Sunday 8 September, 30 Londoners will be invited to join two free weaving sessions between 10.00-12.00 and 14.00-16.00 at Chingford Community Hub to help create the London Overground Weaver line roundel. Participants will work together to create a woven textile of the Weaver line roundel that will be displayed in one of the stations along the London Overground Weaver line for millions of people to see.

The weaving sessions will be held at Chingford Community Hub, which is next to Chingford London Overground station and part of what will become the London Overground Weaver line this autumn. Arriva Rail London (ARL) began work in 2021 to transform unused areas of Chingford, Highams Park and other London Overground stations into local community spaces.

The unused Victorian-era spaces at Chingford and Highams Park London Overground stations were renovated and transformed into dynamic community hubs using funds from Arriva Rail London, Waltham Forest Council, community groups and lottery organisations. The new station community hubs now offer spaces that celebrate local heritage and provide great opportunities for residents and local groups to host events and work flexibly.

The London Overground line between Liverpool Street, Cheshunt, Enfield Town and Chingford will be named the Weaver line this autumn to celebrate the rich history of tapestry, art and design from the areas which the line runs through. The Weaver line runs through Liverpool Street, Spitalfields, Bethnal Green and Hackney - areas of London known for their textile trade, shaped over the centuries by diverse migrant communities and individuals. This free community event celebrates and spotlights the organisations that are passing on these traditions and legacies to Londoners today.

Cockpit is a charity and award-winning social enterprise, home to 160 independent creative businesses in London who offer studio space and business advice for people starting craft-related projects and businesses.

London's Deputy Mayor for Communities and Social Justice, Dr Debbie Weekes-Bernard, said: 

'Naming the London Overground lines will make it easier to navigate the network while honouring and celebrating London's unique local history and culture.

'The Weaver line, launching in autumn, runs through areas of London known for their textile trade, shaped over the centuries by diverse migrant communities and individuals.

'I encourage Londoners to take part in these free community sessions, which are a brilliant chance to create a lasting piece of artwork for the London Overground Weaver line.'

Emma Strain, Customer Director at TfL, said: 

'The Weaver line, which will launch this autumn, runs through an area with deep rooted connections to all things textile and this free community event offers Londoners a truly special opportunity to become a part of this legacy. The completed tapestry will symbolise the power of collaboration, unity and the creativity of Londoners.'

Jonathan Burton, CEO, Cockpit said: 

'Cockpit is delighted to be working with TfL on this project celebrating London's rich heritage of textile production.  As a community of professional makers, Cockpit recognises how craft, creativity and skills can bring people together, creating something exceptional to be shared with the public and encouraging us to reflect on those industries that supported so many in the past.'

A programme of activities throughout 2024 celebrate the rich history of the six new names and colours for London Overground lines, including a 'Mind the Gap' podcast series celebrating the communities and stories that inspired the new names of the London Overground lines. The first two episodes of the podcast about the London Overground Mildmay and Lioness lines are available to listen to and download. The 'Mind the Gap' podcast series was produced by 18Sixty and is available on all major podcast platforms.

TfL is running a competition to celebrate the rich history of the six new names and colours for London Overground lines. People are being encouraged to create a poster or poem for each line that will feature on the London Overground network later in the year. Further details on the competition and how to enter before the closing date on the 30 August can be found on the Made by TfL blog.

2024-08-16,Aug, TfL calls for final scrappage scheme applications as scheme planned to wind down,"Successful scrappage scheme has committed more than £186m, supporting nearly 54,000 applicants to switch to cleaner, greener modes of transport
 
 




 ""I am proud that the scrappage scheme - the biggest in the UK - has supported so many Londoners to switch to cleaner, greener vehicles. ULEZ compliance has now reached more than 96 per cent, bringing cleaner air to millions of Londoners""
 
 Sadiq Khan
 The Mayor of London
 


 
TfL's proposed deadline for new applications is 23:59 on 7 September
Any application made before the proposed deadline is guaranteed to be processed
The Mayor is proposing to make a donation to British Ukrainian Aid to enable vehicles to continue being sent to Ukraine
In the first six months of the London-wide expansion of the ULEZ the savings in NOx emissions from cars and vans is estimated to be equivalent to removing 200,000 cars from the road for one year*
Overall, NO2 concentrations in outer London are estimated to be 21 per cent lower than without the ULEZ **
Grace periods for community transport and disabled Londoners remain open until October 2027
Transport for London is today (Friday 16 August) calling on any remaining Londoners who wish to use the ULEZ scrappage scheme to submit their applications by 23:59 on 7 September ahead of its planned closure.

The scheme for the expanded outer London area has now seen more than £186m committed to around 54,000 applicants. This was on top of the £61m for the central and inner London ULEZ, which led to more than 15,000 successful applications. The scheme, which opened in January 2023, was expanded to cover all Londoners in the capital ahead of the launch of the London-wide ULEZ. It has been highly successful in supporting people to adapt to the world-leading clean air zone.

The vast majority of people with older, more polluting vehicles have already taken action and application numbers have dropped sharply in recent weeks.  With compliance levels in London now at over 96 per cent, the scrappage scheme has been successful in achieving its objectives. TfL has seen a 53 per cent reduction in non-compliant vehicles driving on an average day over the six months of expansion compared to June 2023. ***

With application volumes now considerably lower after more than 18 months of operation, it is proposed that new applicants will have until 23:59 on 7 September to submit their applications. In addition, it is proposed that the grace period for minibuses used by not-for-profit organisations for community transport is extended from October 2025 to October 2027. Grace periods for community transport and disabled Londoners remain open until October 2027.

It is proposed that any funds remaining following the planned closure will be considered for other uses to further the Mayor's Transport Strategy.

Any application made before the proposed deadline would be guaranteed to be processed and reviewed for eligibility. This includes people wishing to donate their vehicle to Ukraine. Following the planned winding down of the scheme, the Mayor is proposing to make a donation to British Ukrainian Aid to enable vehicles to continue being sent to Ukraine.

Since the scrappage scheme opened over 18 months ago, 53,944 applications have been approved, with £186,089,700 allocated in total. This includes:

36,008 Londoners who have had their application approved to scrap their non-compliant car or motorcycle, totalling £69,502,200 in grants.
17,936 applications approved to scrap or retrofit a van or minibus, totalling £116,587,500 in grants.
Of these:

232 charities had their applications approved, totalling £1,716,500 in grants 
17,704 small businesses, including sole traders, have had their applications approved, totalling £114,871,000 in grants.
These figures include more than 330 vehicles donated to Ukraine.
The expanded ULEZ has helped five million more Londoners to breathe cleaner air and is part of the Mayor and TfL's wider programme to reduce air pollution and its associated health impacts. In London, around 4,000 premature deaths are attributed to toxic air each year****. Air pollution is also linked to increased risks of asthma, cancer and dementia.*****

The London-wide ULEZ Six Month Report showed its effectiveness in driving down emissions and improving the quality of the capital's air. Within the outer London ULEZ area, NOx emissions from cars and vans are estimated to be 13 and seven per cent lower than a scenario without the expansion. This is equivalent to removing 200,000 cars from the road for one year. Thanks to all phases of the ULEZ,  roadside NO2 concentrations in outer London are estimated to be 21 per cent lower than without the ULEZ and its expansions.**

The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan said: 

'I am proud that the scrappage scheme - the biggest in the UK - has supported so many Londoners to switch to cleaner, greener vehicles. ULEZ compliance has now reached more than 96 per cent, bringing cleaner air to millions of Londoners.

'I'm also pleased that after the huge success of the Ukraine scheme, I'm planning to provide additional funding so that vehicles can continue to be donated to the country once the scrappage scheme closes.

'I remain committed to taking world-leading action to improve London's air quality and encourage sustainable transport.'

Christina Calderato, TfL's Director of Strategy, said: 

'The expanded ULEZ has meant that more than five million people are now breathing cleaner air and from the Six Month Report we have seen its success in driving down air pollutant emissions and concentrations. Harmful roadside nitrogen dioxide in outer London has fallen by over 20 per cent through the different phases of the scheme. The £186 million we have committed so far through the scrappage scheme has been instrumental in the over 96 per cent of vehicles we are now seeing complying with the standards.

'We have seen enthusiastic take up of the scrappage scheme after it was opened to all Londoners. With the vast majority of those needing support to adapt to the ULEZ having already taken action and nearly 54,000 thousand applications approved, demand for the scheme is now much lower. We encourage anyone who still needs support to submit their application before 8 September. Any remaining funds will then be considered for other proposed uses to further the Mayor's Transport Strategy.'

*This is similar to the volume of NOx emissions that 200,000 cars would produce over one year, based on the NTS 2022 average mileage of 10,560 km per year.

2024-08-19,Aug, New TfL campaign launches to tackle violence against staff on London’s transport network,"New campaign will emphasise zero tolerance approach to all forms of work-related violence and aggression on London's public transport network, making it clear that abuse has serious consequences
 
 




 ""This new campaign aims to send a strong message to offenders that staff abuse won't be tolerated on our services and that you will be caught and face serious consequences""
 
 Siwan Hayward
 TfL's Director of Security, Policing and Enforcement
 


 
Campaign uses examples of prosecutions to make it clear that abuse has serious consequences, including one offender being handed a 38-week prison sentence
TfL has seen an increase in all incidents of work-related violence and aggression against staff, with 200 incidents reported on average every week in 2023/24
TfL will always work with the police to push for the strongest sentences possible for offenders 
Transport for London (TfL) has launched a new campaign to tackle violence and aggression against staff on the transport network, sending a strong message to offenders that it is not tolerated on TfL's services and making it clear that both physical and verbal abuse is a criminal offence with consequences. TfL takes work-related violence and aggression extremely seriously and this new campaign is one element of its work to ensure its staff are safe, feel safe and are supported.

TfL staff work hard to serve the millions of customers who use the transport network every day and have the right to go about their work without fear or intimidation. There has been an increase in all incidents of work-related violence and aggression, with higher numbers of verbal abuse, threats, hate and aggression being reported. In 2023/24 there were 10,493 reports of work-related violence and aggression, compared to 9,989 in 2022/23, an increase of five per cent. TfL encourages all staff to report any instance of abuse, whether physical or non-physical, so that proactive measures can be taken, and the overall increase in reporting could indicate that staff have more confidence to report, knowing that every incident will be taken seriously.

While total incidents have increased, the number of physical incidents reported recently has decreased. From 1 April to 22 June 2024, 197 physical incidents were reported by directly employed TfL staff, a 20 per cent reduction compared to the same period last year, when there were 248 reported incidents. TfL hopes to continue seeing this downward trend through the widespread adoption of body worn video (BWV) camera, deployment of Transport Support Enforcement Officers and rollout of conflict management training.

The campaign uses real life incidents of staff abuse to send a clear message to perpetrators that they will be caught, and action will be taken. TfL will always work with the police to ensure anyone who assaults its colleagues is brought to justice. Examples of incidents across the campaign include:  

A young man who violently threatened and assaulted a female Customer Service Assistant during rush hour at King's Cross St. Pancras station in June 2023. He was sentenced to 38 weeks in prison 
A teenager who spat at and racially abused a Customer Service Assistant at Balham station during rush hour in May 2023. She was arrested and sentenced to 3 weeks in prison 
A 59-year-old man who verbally and physically assaulted a bus driver in Cromwell bus station in 2022. He was arrested and later sentenced to 20 months in prison 
The new campaign builds on efforts by TfL and police to tackle work-related violence and aggression across the network. Earlier this year, TfL made BWV part of its essential kit for frontline customer facing staff. Research shows that the risk of assaults on colleagues can almost halve when wearing a BWV camera, and the footage can provide vital evidence to the police if an assault does occur, resulting in better outcomes when offenders go to court.

TfL Transport Support and Enforcement (TSE) officers are also deployed across the network to provide support to operational customer-facing colleagues, challenge work-related violence and provide a highly visible reassuring presence to staff and customers. In January, TfL launched its first Night Team of TSE officers in the first four weeks of deployment, the TSE officers removed 47 passengers who were refusing to comply with the rules and regulations of the network and were obstructive or threatened TfL staff. Officers are highly trained in conflict management with powers and equipment to deal with anti-social behaviour and enforce byelaws and regulations.

Earlier this year, TfL also launched a new programme of conflict management training for customer-facing operational teams working in high-risk locations for work-related violence and aggression across London Underground, Bus Operations and River Services.  This training provides essential knowledge and skills, covering positive interactions to reduce the risks of violence and aggression, dynamic risk assessments and de-escalation skills.

Siwan Hayward, TfL's Director of Security, Policing and Enforcement, said:

'Everyone has the right to work without fear of being assaulted, abused or threatened. We take work-related violence and aggression extremely seriously and will always encourage staff to report any instance of abuse whether physical or non-physical. This means that preventative measures can be taken and the strongest penalties brought against offenders. This new campaign aims to send a strong message to offenders that staff abuse won't be tolerated on our services and that you will be caught and face serious consequences. We are committed to doing all we can to protect our colleagues and keep them safe, and to eradicate work-related violence and aggression.'

Conor Geraghty, TfL Transport Support Enforcement Officer, said:

 'I am pleased to see TfL's continued commitment to everyone having the right to work in a safe and supportive environment. I am proud and honoured to be part of TfL, where I have the opportunity to contribute to efforts to combat workplace violence and aggression. As a CPOS operational officer, I am acutely aware of the positive impact my role has, and I am empowered to make a tangible difference on the frontline.'

Chief Superintendent Tom Naughton, Head of the Met's Road and Transport Policing Command, said: 

'Anyone who is abusive, aggressive or violent towards staff on London's transport network can expect to be arrested and prosecuted.

'The recent prosecutions that have resulted in prison sentences demonstrate the consequences of criminal behaviour towards TfL staff.'

British Transport Police Superintendent Dominique Ioannou, said: 

'No person on the rail network should ever be subjected to violence or abuse, especially rail staff who are simply doing their job. We take assaults towards members of rail staff extremely seriously and it will not be tolerated on the network under any circumstance. We continue to work closely with TfL to tackle the issue and we will explore all investigative avenues to identify and prosecute offenders. This includes encouraging staff to report incidents to us and supporting the use of body worn cameras for frontline rail staff. We know from experience that body worn video is a fantastic tool that not only record incidents, which we can then use to secure convictions, but also acts as a deterrent in the first instance, helping to de-escalate situations. We encourage passengers who experience or witnesses any crime onboard a train or at a station to report it to us by texting 61016, calling 0800 40 50 40 or via the free Railway Guardian app. Always call 999 in an emergency.'

Last week, a man was sentenced to 10- months imprisonment after he racially abused a bus driver in London and violently attacked a betting shop. Michael Mongan, 39, of Castle Road, Ealing, west London, spat at the bus driver's cab a number of times while shouting Islamophobic abuse and other threats. TfL will always work with the police to ensure anyone who assaults its staff is brought to justice as quickly as possible. ",0.25725809832040214,Mon,0.97,1.2,1.05,1.02,NA,NA,0.73,0.97,0.86,1.0161904761904763,1.0426540284360188,1.0275800711743774,1.0218579234972678,NA,NA,0.991358024691358,0.9816007359705612,0.9712525667351128,1.0260148656375072,1.0272427555092833,1.0140293637846656,1.0262406526172672,NA,NA,0.8470403763230105,1.0152024446142094,1.0041762550072444
2024-08-20,Aug, TfL gets into Carnival spirit to celebrate Caribbean culture and heritage ahead of Notting Hill Carnival,"Notting Hill Carnival returns for the August Bank Holiday weekend (Sunday 25 and Monday 26 August) with more than two million people expected to visit west London to celebrate the city's diverse Caribbean community
 
 




 ""WGLA are thrilled to join Transport for London and Mas band Masology Making Carnival for a second year at this vibrant celebration of culture and heritage""

 CEO The Windrush Generation Legacy Association Charity, said
 


 
London's transport network is expected to be busier than usual over the bank holiday weekend 
TfL recommends passengers get off at Paddington station and walk to Notting Hill Carnival and that customers plan and check their journeys before travelling to the Carnival 
TfL is teaming up with Mas band Masology to take part in their Return to the Motherland-themed float for this year 
Ahead of the Notting Hill Carnival this weekend, TfL is offering travel advice for people travelling to enjoy the largest street party in Europe. 

The capital has already started to gear up for this year's Carnival, which will return to west London between Sunday 25 and Monday 26 August. Last year's August Bank Holiday ridership figures for buses and the Tube reached the highest levels since the pandemic, as millions of people attended big events in the capital. This year, TfL is expecting an even busier bank holiday so it's important that customers make sure they plan their journeys ahead of time. 

For the easiest and least-crowded journey to Notting Hill Carnival, customers are advised to take London Underground or Elizabeth line services to Paddington station as the Carnival is only a 20-minute walk away. The Bakerloo, Circle and Hammersmith & City lines, as well as the Elizabeth line offer step-free access, while the District line also serves the station. Smaller Tube stations such as Notting Hill Gate and Westbourne Park closer to the parade can get extremely busy.

Customers are encouraged to plan their journeys in advance using the TfL Go app or using Journey Planner on the TfL website. 

TfL is joining up with partners Windrush Generation Legacy Association (WGLA) to appear in Mas band Masology's float at this year's Notting Hill Carnival. The theme for the float is Return to the Motherland, which will celebrate Caribbean culture and heritage. The Masology float will join a bus featuring Carnival-inspired designs from Go Ahead London, which operates buses in the area on behalf of TfL, in the main parade, with TfL staff taking part in the celebrations on both the float and the bus.  

TfL has also teamed up with Anthony Nolan, the stem cell transplant charity which has been saving lives for 50 years, and WGLA charities and will support them through the sale of themed pin badges to staff. TfL will donate all proceeds from Notting Hill Carnival 2024 pin badge sales to Anthony Nolan. 

Emma Strain, TfL's Customer Director, said: ""Carnival celebrates London's wonderful diversity, and there is no better way to end a fantastic summer of events across the capital than welcoming back Notting Hill Carnival.

""Smaller Tube stations such as Notting Hill Gate and Westbourne Park closer to the parade can get extremely busy. The easiest way to travel to the Carnival is by public transport and for people to use large well-connected stations such as Paddington and walk to the parade. This year, as with every other, we are working closely with Carnival organisers and the police to make sure we all enjoy another successful event."" 

Deborah Klass, CEO The Windrush Generation Legacy Association Charity, said: ""WGLA are thrilled to join Transport for London and Mas band Masology Making Carnival for a second year at this vibrant celebration of culture and heritage. As a charity committed to honouring and preserving the legacy of the Windrush Generation, we are especially excited to bring 40 children from the Croydon Supplementary Education Project to Children's Day this year, fully dressed in costumes that reflect our rich cultural history. The theme 'Back to the Motherland, with a Windrush twist' perfectly encapsulates our mission to celebrate and pass on the diverse heritage of the Windrush Generation to future generations.""

Tom Joyner, Go-Ahead London's Managing Director, said: ""As the capital's biggest, most experienced and innovative zero emission bus operator, we're delighted that one of our iconic red electric buses is once again an integral part of the Carnival float. Carnival reflects the communities we serve, the colleagues we employ and our city's diversity and we're proud to be a part of it.

""London's air is cleaner as a result of an ever-growing number of environmentally friendly buses entering service and we look forward to working with the Mayor, TfL and our supply chain to deliver even more of them over the coming years.""",0.283659894975514,Tue,0.95,1.16,1.03,1,NA,NA,0.77,0.97,0.87,0.9952380952380953,1.0078988941548184,1.0080071174377225,1.0018214936247722,NA,NA,1.0456790123456792,0.9816007359705612,0.9825462012320328,1.0048599199542596,0.9930013303256405,0.9947145187601958,1.0061182868796736,NA,NA,0.893453547628381,1.0152024446142094,1.015852723088724

Nearly 700,000 people attended the eight gigs this summer - with more performances in London than anywhere else in the world
Gigs and concerts with global music superstars boost public transport usage, with Taylor Swift's shows in June taking Wembley Park Tube station past 150,000 entries and exits in a day for the first time since the pandemic  
Transport for London (TfL) welcomed visitors from around the world this August, as people flocked to public transport for unmissable events in the capital, including Taylor Swift's final five nights at Wembley Stadium.

There were more than 441,000 recorded entries and exits at Wembley Park Tube station across Thursday 15 August, Friday 16 August and Saturday 17 August, as fans travelled from around the world to see the latest performances in Taylor Swift's The Eras Tour at Wembley Stadium. There were 146,293 on Thursday 15 August, 153,727 on Friday 16 August, and 141,552 on Saturday 17 August, with hundreds of thousands more expected to have passed through the station for the final two nights on Monday 19 August and Tuesday 20 August*.

During the first three dates of her tour in June, Wembley Park Tube station broke more than 150,000 entries and exits in a day for the first time since 2019, with 167,237 entries and exits on the Friday 21 June and 153,761 on Saturday 22 June. On Sunday 23 June there were 137,059.

Taylor Swift's record-breaking The Eras Tour is estimated to have boosted the capital's economy by £300m**. Ahead of her first performance in London, TfL launched a Swift-themed Tube map with lines representing albums and songs for stations. London (Taylor's version) has been on display at Wembley Park Tube station to create photo opportunities for fans who attended the concerts and will remain in place for the next few weeks.

There have been a huge range of special events and celebrations to mark the performances. Shoreditch, one of Taylor Swift's favourite places according to London Boy, is now home to a new fan mural of the artist. The mural design, which features Taylor and some of London's most iconic landmarks, was created by @kateclaxtondesigns and brought to life by Global Street Art and VisitLondon.com. Visitors to London can see more from Global Street Art in September as London Mural Festival takes over the capital.

This follows the unveiling of two public artworks at Wembley Park Tube station, including a giant mural on the Spanish Steps, which are being temporarily renamed the 'Swiftie Steps'.

Now Taylor Swift has said So Long London, the capital will continue singing Thank you for the Music at the sell-out ABBA Voyage concert four days a week, which has been extended until May 2025. The spectacular virtual show has seen entries and exits at Pudding Mill Lane DLR station soar since the start of the show in late May 2022. The station continues to see higher entries and exits compared to before the pandemic, with June 2024 seeing more than 162,000 entries and exits across the month.

Stratford station also saw its two busiest days so far this year in June as Foo Fighters played at nearby London Stadium on 20 and 22 June, with 225,785 and 229,952 entries and exits respectively.

London has had a fantastic summer of international and homegrown music performing, including Green Day and Bruce Springsteen at Wembley Stadium, Burna Boy at the London Stadium, Nicki Minaj, 21 Savage, J Hus and Doja Cat at Wireless Festival in Finsbury Park, Kylie, SZA and Stray Kids at BST Hyde Park.

The TfL network has also been further boosted with the return of Premier League football, which saw four top-flight matches taking place in London over the weekend helping the Tube see a total of 6,043,345 entries and exits across the network on Saturday, an increase of eight per cent on last year, and 4,385,991 on Sunday, an increase of nine per cent on last year.

The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said: ""It's a huge honour that Taylor Swift chose to perform more nights of her record-breaking The Eras Tour in London than any other city. Her eight concerts at Wembley Stadium have seen nearly 700,000 'Swifties' travel from all corners of the world to be here, boosting our economy and proving that London is truly the music capital of the world. I'd also like to thank the police and security staff in London for all their work in making sure the events went ahead safely.

""Our spectacular summer of music and sport has seen people make the most of our fantastic transport network, and there is lots more for everyone to enjoy in the coming months as we continue to build a better London for everyone.""

Emma Strain, TfL's Customer Director, said: ""London is always open to everyone and whether you enjoyed attending The Eras Tour, or are gearing up for another big gig or festival this summer, we're here to welcome you all to our great city. With parks across London hosting an incredible line-up of festivals and live music, all just a short ride away on public transport, there's no better time to explore what the city has to offer.""

Laura Citron OBE, CEO at VisitLondon.com, said: ""Music is a huge tourism driver for London and this summer has been absolutely massive. Taylor Swift's record-breaking London shows have seen hotel searches up as much as four times higher than 2023 as Swifties entered the capital. Beyond London's music scene, there's a fantastic array of festivals, parades, and lush parks for visitors to enjoy these next few weeks.""

London has proved a popular destination for gigs and concerts as recent research by Visit London.com, the business and destination agency for London, revealed that more people would travel to London for a music event than to other major world cities including Paris and Los Angeles. Figures from TfL show that entries and exits have spiked at the stations closest to venues during recent major gigs and concerts.

Londoners can enjoy plenty of free concerts and music events in central London this summer, all accessible by public transport including: 

The Taylor Swift | Songbook Trail at the V&A, exhibiting 16 looks from the across the singer songwriter's career until 8 September, nearest station South Kensington) 
King's Cross Summer Sounds, a 12-day programme of music and performances until 26 August (nearest station King's Cross St Pancras) 
KERB's lively open-air summer pop-up on the National Theatre piazza is joining forces with Voices Radio to bring a curated lineup of free live music performances and DJs every Sunday afternoon until 25 August, (nearest station Waterloo) 
For Londoners, looking to save on days out over the holidays, TfL customers can save 30 per cent on entry to the Painted Hall at the Old Royal Naval College when using the TfL network*** until 17 November.

The IFS Cloud Cable Car is also offering customers up to 30 per cent discount when tickets are booked online and in advance.

2024-08-23,Aug, London Overground further expands drinking fountain network,"New fountains installed at Bethnal Green, Bush Hill Park, Chingford, Gospel Oak, Highams Park and Homerton stations
 
 




 ""We know how important it is for Londoners to stay hydrated and cool on our network, but I'm also determined to reduce our city's use of single-use plastic""
 
 Sadiq Khan
 The Mayor of London
 


 
Water points on the network help customers reduce the use of single-use plastic, and save money
New handy map is available online to help customers find their nearest drinking fountain
Customers using the London Overground will find it even easier to stay hydrated as Transport for London (TfL) adds a further six free-to-use drinking fountains to its network.

The new drinking fountains are now available at Bethnal Green, Bush Hill Park, Chingford, Gospel Oak, Highams Park and Homerton stations, with these joining the 22* already offering easy access to tap water across the London Overground network.

Carrying water when using public transport is highly recommended, especially during the summer months, and these new drinking fountains will make it even easier for customers to fill their bottle up and stay cool on the transport network.

With the average Londoner buying more than three plastic water bottles every week, or around 175 bottles a year, the drinking fountains available across the London Overground will aim to bring this number down, encouraging customers to use their own refillable bottle

To help London Overground customers find their nearest drinking fountain, TfL has also published a handy map online giving details of their locations, both at London Overground stations or nearby.

The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said: ""We know how important it is for Londoners to stay hydrated and cool on our network, but I'm also determined to reduce our city's use of single-use plastic. That's why we're installing these additional water fountains, along with a helpful map for Londoners to find their nearest fountain, as we continue to build a better, greener London for everyone.""

Rory O'Neill, General Manager for London Overground, said: ""We are committed at London Overground to provide easy access to free drinking water wherever we can. Our growing number of drinking fountains is a testament to that, allowing customers to stay hydrated while using our services but also doing our bit for the environment by helping reduce the reliance on single use plastic bottles.""

The Mayor of London is encouraging Londoners to adopt small changes that can have a big environmental impact, like refilling reusable bottles, instead of needlessly buying single-use ones. Complementing the water fountains on the London Overground, City Hall has partnered with Thames Water to install more than a 100 water fountains in busy and accessible areas of London. 

Access to drinking water in public spaces has also been improved through the Refill London scheme, which encourages London's many restaurants, cafes and businesses to offer free refills and water fountains, making it easier for Londoners and visitors to the capital to refill on the go.

From this autumn, each of the six London Overground lines will be represented by a new name and colour to make it easier for customers to navigate the network, while also celebrating the city's diverse culture and history. 

Ahead of this there is a programme of activities celebrate the rich history of the six new names for the London Overground lines, including a 'Mind the Gap' podcast series celebrating the communities and stories that inspired the new names of the London Overground lines. The first two episodes of the podcast about the London Overground Mildmay and Lioness lines are available to listen to and download. The 'Mind the Gap' podcast series was produced by 18Sixty and is available on all major podcast platforms. 

TfL is running a competition to celebrate the rich history of the six new names for the London Overground lines. People are being encouraged to create a poster or poem for each line that will feature on the London Overground network later in the year.

In a new episode of TfL's Mind the Gap podcast released today, presenter Tim Dunn speaks to former Director of Havering Museum, Ellen Owen, and local historian Brian Evans about the unique history of Havering and how it lives on today
Transport for London (TfL) is celebrating the launch of the new London Overground Liberty line this autumn. People are encouraged to nominate unsung heroes who have made a special contribution to the local community in Havering to win London Overground Liberty line prizes.

The London Overground line connecting Romford and Upminster will become the London Overground Liberty line this autumn. The new name celebrates the unique history of the area, which was a Royal Liberty between 1465 and 1892 where local residents were granted special freedoms compared to the rest of London. TfL is encouraging people to nominate those who have gone above and beyond to support the local community in Havering to win special London Overground prizes to tie into the royal history of the area.

Three unsung heroes will be selected by staff at the three stations along the new Liberty line this autumn. The competition is open until 15 September and the winners will be awarded special transport-related prizes by TfL, akin to the way residents of the Royal Liberty were given special privileges back in the day. These will include an exclusive London Overground cab ride, a behind-the scenes tour of a railway control centre in Romford, an invitation to see the first new London Overground Liberty line signs in place and other Liberty line goodies.

TfL has also dedicated the most recent episode of its Mind the Gap podcast series to explore the unique history of Havering, where residents were even exempt from paying certain tolls and referred to the local courts to resolve local disputes or handle small debt cases.

Host Tim Dunn spoke to Ellen Owen who is a former director of Havering Museum. Ellen now volunteers her time to raise funds and facilitate events for Havering Museum, and talks about how Havering became an area that was far ahead of its time and marked by a strong sense of independence thanks to its status as a Royal Liberty. Later in the episode, Tim joined historian Brian Evans on a walking tour through Romford to uncover the hidden remnants of the former Royal Liberty and learn how it is still remembered today.

The Mind the Gap podcast is exploring each of the six London Overground lines which will be represented by new names and colours this autumn, to make it easier for customers to navigate the network, while also celebrating the city's diverse culture and history. The first two episodes of the podcast about the London Overground Mildmay and Lioness lines are available to listen to and download. The 'Mind the Gap' podcast series was produced by 18Sixty and is available on all major podcast platforms.

Deputy Mayor for Transport, Seb Dance, said: ""The London Overground line connecting Romford and Upminster will become the Liberty line in autumn, in celebration of Havering's rich local history. It's a great opportunity for locals to get involved, as we make the London Overground easier to navigate, while celebrating the diversity of London's heritage and communities.""

Emma Strain, Customer Director at TfL, said: ""Our new Mind the Gap podcast episode celebrates some of Havering's fascinating history. Alongside this, as part of the naming of the London Overground Liberty line, we're looking for people who support the local community in Havering, we encourage everyone to nominate those who have gone above and beyond for the community to win special London Overground Liberty line prizes. Tune in to our podcast to learn more about this lesser-known part of British history.""

Tim Dunn, Railway Historian and Broadcaster, said: ""Our public transport network represents the freedom to get around the city for so many Londoners, whether that's to work, to school, to visit loved ones - That's part of the liberty embodied by the naming of this line. The new name for the London Overground line also reflects the area's history of course, and I can't wait for people to hear some of the intriguing stories of Havering's past in the new podcast episode.""

Ellen Owen, former Director of Havering Museum, said: ""Havering is brilliant, it's moving forward, but not everyone knows about the liberty. What the London Overground line naming inspires is liberty, freedom, and autonomy. There's so much history behind the name.""

Brian Evans, Author and Historian, said: ""The first day the London Overground line is officially known as the Liberty line, I will feel exultant! Liberty is already on people's mind because it's featured on the badge of Havering borough. But they don't all associate it, like me, with being a bit cheeky! People in this borough are independent still.""

Nomination boxes have been installed at Romford and Upminster stations, allowing people to nominate a person they would like to see rewarded, be it for their volunteering work, dedication to community causes or other noteworthy contributions to the wellbeing of those around them. Submissions can also be made by speaking to a member of staff at Emerson Park station or via email to libertylinecompetition@tfl.gov.uk.

TfL is also running a competition to encourage people to create a poster or a poem for each line that will feature on the London Overground network later in the year. People have until the 30 August to submit their poster and poem entries and more information can be found on the Made by TfL Blog.",0.2839308528648023,Wed,0.96,1.16,1.05,1,NA,NA,0.76,1.01,0.9,1.0057142857142858,1.0078988941548184,1.0275800711743774,1.0018214936247722,NA,NA,1.0320987654320988,1.0220791168353267,1.0164271047227926,1.0154373927958833,0.9930013303256405,1.0140293637846656,1.0061182868796736,NA,NA,0.8818502548020384,1.057066462948816,1.0508821273331628
2024-09-02,Sep, New bus service connecting Golders Green and Stamford Hill now up and running,"New bus route 310 service now operating between Golders Green and Stamford Hill
 
 




 ""I'm delighted that the 310 bus route is now up and running, and serving the community""
 
 Sadiq Khan
 The Mayor of London
 


 
Mayor of London pledged to introduce new bus route to support local residents, including London's Jewish community
Consultation open for feedback until August 2025
Transport for London's (TfL) new bus service, route 310, is now operating between Golders Green and Stamford Hill. The introduction of the service follows a commitment made by the Mayor of London earlier this year in response to a longstanding request from residents, particularly in the local Jewish community, for a service to connect the neighbourhoods.

This is the first time that the two areas have been connected by a direct bus service. The 310 provides a safe, accessible, sustainable and affordable form of public transport connecting residents in North London, with the new route playing an important role in enabling more people in the area to switch from car use to public transport, reducing congestion and improving air quality across the area and beyond.

TfL is running a public consultation to assess the response to the service over the next 12 months, to allow Londoners to provide feedback on how the service is running and to inform TfL's longer-term service plans. TfL will be working closely with local communities during this period to promote use of the route and to encourage communities to share their feedback.

Route 310 connects communities in Golders Green and Stamford Hill, serving people in the boroughs of Hackney, Barnet, Islington, Camden and Haringey, including stops at Highgate Village, Whittington Hospital and Finsbury Park. The trial of the bus route is part of TfL's wider vision to improve public transport in London, as outlined in the Bus Action Plan.

As well as the introduction of the 310 bus route, there will also be improvements to route 210, which runs parallel to the 310, between Brent Cross Shopping Centre and Finsbury Park from Saturday 21 September. Buses will operate every 12 minutes instead of every 15 minutes before 07:00 on weekdays and before 09:00 on Saturdays and Sundays. The first buses on Sunday mornings will also start earlier to provide a consistent start time to buses on all days of the week, meaning customers will benefit from buses operating up to 90 minutes earlier than they do currently.

The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said: ""I'm delighted that the 310 bus route is now up and running, and serving the community. I pledged to Londoners when I was re-elected that I would introduce this route, and I'm pleased to be delivering on this promise. The brand-new bus route will connect Golders Green and Stamford Hill with a direct service for the first time, supporting many local residents, particularly in the Jewish community, and helping to build a safer, fairer and greener London for everyone.""

Geoff Hobbs, TfL's Director of Public Transport Service Planning, said: ""We welcome all customers on board the new 310 bus and encourage people to use the service as much as possible and provide feedback during the consultation period. Feedback is hugely important to us and will enable us to create a bus service that benefits everyone using public transport services in the local area. We hope the new route will help to increase the use of buses and reduce car use by improving travel options for people living in the area."" 

Andrew Gilbert and Adrian Cohen, Co-Chairs of the London Jewish Forum and recently appointed Vice Presidents of the Board of Deputies, said: ""In a period where our community is encountering unprecedented antisemitism, any measure that bolsters the confidence of Jewish individuals in using public transport is immensely valued.

""This is something we have been campaigning for over 15 years. Stamford Hill and Golders Green have always been centres of Jewish communal life in North London. A direct bus service connecting these hubs will provide substantial benefits to the community.""

Rabbi Dovid Lichtig, Chief Executive, Interlink Foundation, said: ""We welcome the introduction of the new 310 bus route, which will significantly enhance connectivity between our communities in Golders Green and Stamford Hill. We extend our appreciation to the TfL Commissioner and the Mayor of London for making this possible. This service is not just about providing earlier and more frequent buses; it's about bringing people together, improving access to essential services, and supporting sustainable travel options. We encourage everyone to use this service and share their experiences to help ensure it meets the needs of all those it was intended to serve."" 

Cllr Alan Schneiderman, Barnet Council's Cabinet Member for Environment and Climate Change, said: ""It's great to see this new bus route up and running in response to a campaign by the local communities for a service to connect these neighbourhoods. The 310 is an important new transport link, helping to reduce car use by providing a sustainable and affordable travel option for people travelling across north London, accessing key services and visiting local businesses.""",0.30947288418198127,Mon,0.95,1.19,1.05,1,NA,NA,0.75,1,0.9,0.9882108183079057,0.9938752783964364,0.9993654822335026,0.9881422924901185,NA,NA,0.842065868263473,1.0309278350515465,1.035276073619632,1.0048599199542596,1.0186823992133727,1.0140293637846656,1.0061182868796736,NA,NA,0.8702469619756958,1.0466004583651642,1.0508821273331628
2024-09-06,Sep, TfL provides update on ongoing cyber security incident,"TfL today, Friday 06 September, issued an update in relation to the ongoing cyber security incident that it is managing
 
 



 
Shashi Verma, TfL's Chief Technology Officer, said:

'The security of our systems and customer data is very important to us. We continually monitor who is accessing our systems to ensure only those authorised can gain access.  We identified some suspicious activity on Sunday and took action to limit access.  A thorough investigation is currently taking place and we are working closely with the National Crime Agency and the National Cyber Security Centre to respond to the incident. 

'Internal measures to limit access remain in place and there remains no impact to our public transport services and no evidence that any customer data has been compromised. However, as part of the measures implemented to deal with the ongoing cyber security incident, we have temporarily restricted access to customer journey history for pay as you go contactless customers, as well as limited access to some live travel data via apps, TfL Go and the TfL website, including next train information and the TfL JamCams.

'In addition, we have made the decision to temporarily restrict access to the photocard portal, which allows customers to apply for travel concessions, including the Zip Photocard, 16+ and 18+ Photocard and the 60+ Oyster photocard. We apologise for any inconvenience that these temporary changes will cause to some customers and are working to bring these back online as quickly as possible. 

'Earlier this week, the booking system for Dial a Ride was also temporarily unavailable - although pre-existing bookings were still fulfilled - again as a result of the internal measures implemented by us. Essential bookings are now able to be made again by phone and we are looking to return a full call centre service in the coming days.

'We will continue to keep our customers and our staff updated on the incident as part of this ongoing work and thank them for their patience as we respond to this incident.'

The new episode explores the history of the Suffragettes ahead of the London Overground's Gospel Oak to Barking Riverside route being named the Suffragette line later this autumn
Each of the six London Overground lines will be given a new name and colour this autumn to make it easier for customers to navigate the network, while celebrating London's diverse culture and history
Transport for London's (TfL's) new Mind the Gap podcast episode delves into the history behind the London Overground Suffragette line, with interviews with activist and scholar Helen Pankhurst, Emmeline Pankhurst's great-granddaughter, and comedian and writer, Cally Beaton.

This autumn, the London Overground line connecting north west and east London will be named the Suffragette line and represented on the map with two parallel green lines, as part of the new names and colours for each of the six Overground lines, making it easier for customers to navigate London's transport network while also celebrating the city's diverse culture and history.

In episode four of the Mind the Gap podcast, presenter Tim Dunn visits Barking Riverside London Overground station, in east London, where he speaks with Helen Pankhurst. Helen is the great-granddaughter of Suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst, who was one of key Suffragette leaders from east London who campaigned for women's rights. During the interview Helen talks about the impact her great-grandmother and family had on her views on women's rights and her own work, the history of the Suffragette movement and current women's rights issues and challenges. Helen also talks about the work of her grandmother Sylvia Pankhurst, who was also a key figure in the Suffragette movement and had strong links to the working classes in the East End of London.

In the second part of the episode, Tim speaks with British comedian and writer Cally Beaton at Gospel Oak London Overground station. Cally talks about her journey of becoming the first female board member at ITV and a champion for women in business. Cally then speaks about how she became a comedian, the influence of comedy legend Joan Rivers, and how perceptions of women in comedy still have a way to go.

The London Overground Suffragette line has been named following engagement with local communities and honours how the working-class movement in the East End paved the way for women's rights. Barking, at the eastern end of the line, was home of the longest surviving Suffragette Annie Huggett, who died aged 103.

London's Deputy Mayor for Communities and Social Justice, Dr Debbie Weekes-Bernard, said: ""This autumn, the London Overground line connecting north west and east London will be named the Suffragette line to commemorate this historic campaign, which helped gain women the right to vote. I encourage Londoners to tune into the latest episode of TfL's Mind the Gap podcast featuring Emmeline Pankhurst's great-granddaughter Helen Pankhurst to learn more about the history behind this pivotal movement and the inspiration behind the line's historic name change.""

Emma Strain, Customer Director at TfL, said: ""We hope that our new podcast episode with Emmeline Pankhurst's great-granddaughter, activist and scholar, Helen Pankhurst and comedian and podcaster, Cally Beaton will inspire our customers to find out more about the fascinating history of the Suffragettes.

""The podcast highlights the profound impact Suffragettes had to transform women's rights across the UK and beyond. Both women are truly inspirational, and we hope that our customers enjoy discovering more about this rich part of our history.""

Helen Pankhurst, activist and scholar, said: ""People travelling on the what will become the London Overground Suffragette line will be connected to a local, national and global movement for gender equality and women's rights, one that demanded that women should be counted as citizens and that their views should be represented in parliament. The line honours the past and I hope it will inform the present and the future. In terms of gender equality and political representation, we are not yet at the end of the line, there is still work to be done and the name of this TfL line will encourage discussion and remind us of how of far we have come.""

Cally Beaton, comedian, podcaster and writer, said: ""Wouldn't it be nice to think Emmeline Pankhurst would look at us now, over 100 years since some women got the vote, and think we'd got it sorted in terms of women's rights and equality. We still have work to do, building on the foundations she and her fellow activists laid, and I reckon they'd love that there's a Suffragette line to celebrate all they achieved. Until the day I never again hear the sentence 'women aren't funny', I'm all aboard.""

The legacy of women's empowerment lives on, as Arriva Rail London (ARL), which operates the London Overground on behalf of TfL, makes strides in recruiting more women. The operator recently appointed Anjuli Ramburuth as its Finance Director, and she joins Engineering Director Kate Marjoribanks and Customer Experience Director Charlotte Whitfield, who together make up half of ARL's management team.

London Overground customers were treated to a surprise this week as an actress dressed as Suffragette leader, Emmeline Pankhurst joined them on what will become the Suffragette line this autumn to mark the release of Transport for London's (TfL's) new Mind the Gap podcast episode.

 TfL's Director of Capital Delivery Infrastructure
 


 
The new trams will provide customers with a more comfortable and reliable service, with new features including mobile charge points and real-time travel information
The new generation of trams will start to be introduced in the late 2020s, subject to funding
An option to procure additional trams in the future that could enable a full fleet replacement
The search for a manufacturer to design and build a new fleet of trams to replace the oldest ones operating on the London Trams network has begun, as Transport for London (TfL) has issued an Invitation to Tender (ITT).

Four pre-qualified manufacturers, Alstom Transport UK Limited, Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles S.A (CAF), Hitachi Rail Limited and Stadler Rail Valencia S.A.U, can now proceed to the next stage of the formal procurement process with TfL to design and build the next generation of trams that will, subject to funding, start to be introduced in the late 2020s.

The new trams will offer customers a more comfortable and reliable service along with several improved features including a redesigned interior, air-conditioning, the latest audio and visual real-time travel information, and mobile device charging points. The new trams will include a multi-use area that is designated primarily for wheelchair users but is also able to accommodate pushchairs and luggage when not in use.

The new trams will also feature the latest safety features building on improvements already made on the network, as TfL works to eliminate deaths and serious injuries across London's transport network as part of TfL's Vision Zero commitments.

Scott Haxton, TfL's Director of Capital Delivery Infrastructure, said:

'This invitation for tram manufacturers to submit bids for the design and manufacture of the next generation of trams on the London Trams network is a significant next step.  Subject to funding, these trams will start to enter service in the late 2020s and will provide customers with more comfortable and reliable journeys for many years to come.'

Jason Perry, Executive Mayor of Croydon, said:

'We welcome this positive news from TfL regarding a proposed new fleet of trams which will help support our borough's regeneration. An improved and more reliable service will benefit our residents and everyone who visits and works in Croydon, as they commute around the borough for work and leisure.

'Croydon's trams are a vital piece of infrastructure, connecting remote areas to our town centre. We look forward to seeing this proposed fleet introduced and hope to see longer-term investment secured for the system, providing improved transport links and a welcome boost to the regeneration of our town centre and our local economy.'

The initial contract will be for 24 new trams to replace the oldest trams in the fleet, which have been in use for nearly a quarter of a century.  They are reaching the end of their design life and are becoming less reliable. There will also be an option to extend the contract to build further trams that could replace the remaining trams introduced from 2012.

The award of the contract to design and build the new trams is subject to securing a suitable funding package. TfL continues to discuss its capital funding requirements with Government, including major fleet renewals such as this one. ",0.23295448138414185,Tue,0.96,1.22,1.06,1.01,NA,NA,0.93,0.95,0.85,0.9986130374479889,1.0189309576837415,1.0088832487309645,0.9980237154150198,NA,NA,1.0441616766467066,0.979381443298969,0.9777607361963191,1.0154373927958833,1.0443634681011047,1.0236867862969006,1.0161794697484705,NA,NA,1.0791062328498628,0.994270435446906,0.9924997869257649
2024-09-10,Sep, TfL selects Global and JCDecaux to manage its world-leading advertising contracts,"Following a very competitive tendering process, TfL has selected two companies to manage one of the world's most valuable advertising estates
 
 




 ""Working with both of these companies means we can continue to build on what we've achieved to date and stay at the forefront of what advertisers and audiences want across the capital""
 
 Emma Strain
 Customer Director at TfL
 


 
Global, the Media & Entertainment Group, will continue to manage the rail estate, including advertising sites on the Tube, London Overground, DLR, Tram and across the Elizabeth line
JCDecaux, the multinational outdoor advertising corporation, will continue to manage the advertising at more than 4,700 bus shelters across London
Contracts will begin on 1 April 2025 and last for eight years, with an option for TfL to extend for a further two years
After an extensive procurement process, Transport for London (TfL) has selected Global and JCDecaux to manage its advertising estate, building on the work achieved in recent years.

The new contracts will see Global continue to manage advertising on TfL's rail estate, which includes digital and traditional paper advertising sites on the Tube, London Overground, and Elizabeth line. JCDecaux will continue to manage advertising at more than 4,700 bus shelters, carrying more than 9,000 traditional paper advertising panels and 612 digital advertising panels.

By working with these award-winning Out-of-Home media companies, TfL aims to further develop London's largest advertising estate and continues to champion new ways of bringing brands closer to those travelling across the city by Tube, bus or rail.

TfL and its media partners will work together to bring new, innovative advertising to the millions of people who use London's transport network every day. Building on the current approach, Global and JCDecaux's successful bids demonstrated how they will further utilise data, digitisation and the vast scope of TfL's lucrative advertising space to connect brands with the right audiences.

The TfL advertising estate has seen a series of exciting new campaigns and innovations across the network. This includes a 'super-sized' Adidas shoe on top of bus shelters for the opening of a new Adidas store on Oxford Street, an immersive ABBA Voyage campaign at Waterloo where those travelling on the travellators were accompanied by images of the band's members and three of the group's familiar tunes, along with subtle motion advertising at digital bus shelters and 3D anamorphic advertising being trialled across digital rail sites.  By continuing to innovate and push creativity further, TfL hopes to bring more new ways for brands to reach their customers.

As part of the tender, TfL asked bidders to consider the environmental impact of advertising and to help TfL continue supporting the Mayor in his aim to make London Net Zero by 2030. To help achieve this, TfL is converting lighting in advertising panels within stations to be LED lighting, which uses up to 60 per cent less energy than traditional lighting while providing around 10 per cent brighter light.  Work is also underway to convert lighting in all bus shelters across London, including those used in advertising panels, to LED lighting in the coming months.

Advertising is an important source of revenue for TfL, with *commercial media bringing in approximately £150m to TfL last financial year. This is reinvested back into the public transport network, helping to keep Londoners moving around the capital.

Emma Strain, Customer Director at TfL, said: 

'Advertising income from our estate is a vital source of funding for TfL, so it's really important we work with ambitious and innovative media partners. That's why I am delighted that our trusted brand, environments and the vast, diverse audiences who use our huge estate, are in the hands of internationally recognised commercial media partners, Global and JCDecaux. The TfL advertising estate is a unique canvas in Out-of-Home advertising that brings brands to our customers as they travel around the city. Working with both of these companies means we can continue to build on what we've achieved to date and stay at the forefront of what advertisers and audiences want across the capital.'

Stephen Miron, Global's Group CEO, said: 

'We are delighted to have been awarded the TfL Rail advertising contract until at least 2033, a partnership which has continued for the past 30 years. Without doubt, this is one of the most prestigious outdoor contracts in the world and it's testament to the quality of the team here at Global that TfL decided to continue their relationship with us. We are incredibly excited to implement the plans we presented in our submission, which we believe will make TfL the envy of metros around the globe and will present advertisers with an opportunity to be part of the greatest show under earth!'

Jean-François Decaux, Co-CEO of JCDecaux said:

'We are very proud to win a new 8-year contract with Transport for London, having been the trusted partner for this iconic contract in London's capital city for over 8 years. The strengthening of this long-term partnership is a recognition of JCDecaux's expertise and operational capabilities and our successful digitisation of the second-largest bus shelter advertising contract in the world. Working with TfL, we have delivered new creative, flexible and data-driven opportunities including full programmatic solutions while also enhancing the passenger experience. 81% of Londoners see bus shelter ads every week, making London's bus shelters the big reach medium that brands need. We would like to thank TfL for their continued trust and confidence in JCDecaux, the number one Out-of-Home Media company in the UK and we look forward to continuing our partnership in making London the digital OOH capital of the world.'

Tendering for the advertising contracts began in October 2023, with the new bus shelter and rail contracts both starting on 1 October 2024 with advertising commencement on 1 April 2025. These contracts will last for eight years, with an option for TfL to extend for a further two years.

2024-09-11,Sep, TfL celebrates lifesaving stem cell journeys across London’s transport network,"TfL has partnered with stem cell transport charity Anthony Nolan during Blood Cancer Awareness Month to highlight the importance of stem cell transplants

A new film by TfL and Anthony Nolan highlights the role that public transport plays in supporting volunteer couriers to transport donated cells to patients in need of a transplant throughout the UK and beyond
Anthony Nolan estimates that almost 70 per cent of all trips made by volunteer couriers in 2023 were in London*
Anthony Nolan is marking 50 years since Shirley Nolan set up the world's first stem cell register to find a match for her son Anthony who had a rare blood disorder
The charity is on a mission to grow the stem cell register from just over 900,000 people to one million, to give more patients a better chance of surviving blood cancer and blood disorders
Transport for London (TfL) and stem cell transplant charity Anthony Nolan have joined forces during Blood Cancer Awareness Month with the launch of a new film depicting lifesaving journeys taking place throughout London's transport network.

The new film which has been produced by TfL and Anthony Nolan, features unsung heroes like volunteer courier Irene Robertson who regularly transports donated cells to patients in need of a transplant throughout the UK and beyond.

Stem cell transplants can be the best chance of survival for many patients with blood cancers or blood disorders. Donated cells are given to a patient via their blood stream so that they grow their own new healthy blood cells and platelets. Stem cells are also used by scientists for medical research and to develop new therapies to help more patients.

The film features TfL staff member, Sonja Jutte, who joined the stem cell register in 2005 after a family friend needed a stem cell transplant. She recently donated her stem cells to a patient overseas.

Once stem cells have been donated, volunteer couriers have just 72 hours to transport the stem cells. Irene has been a courier since July 2018 and has taken lifesaving cargo all over the world.

Irene Robertson, Anthony Nolan volunteer courier, said:

'Every time I undertake a trip whether it's to the United States or Surrey, I never cease to be amazed at this lifesaving service.

'Nearly every trip involves using the TfL network to get from A to B in the shortest possible time and to know that someone is waiting for stem cells that will be lifechanging for both them and their family is a very humbling experience.'

Sonja Jutte, Data Scientist for Transport for London, said:

'Whilst donating stem cells is a pretty straight forward outpatient procedure, it's very exciting and a real privilege to give someone a second chance at life.

'With an extremely short window of opportunity, TfL has a crucial role to play in saving lives by providing a reliable and comprehensive transport network.'

TfL also teamed up with Anthony Nolan in August to support them through the sale of Notting Hill Carnival 2024 themed pin badges to staff. TfL is donating all proceeds from the pin badge sales to Anthony Nolan.

During Blood Cancer Awareness Month, Anthony Nolan is marking 50 years since Shirley Nolan set up the world's first stem cell register to find a match for her son Anthony who had a rare blood disorder. Sadly, a match was not found for Anthony, but over the last 50 years Anthony Nolan has facilitated more than 26,500 transplants for people around the world.

Around 97 per cent of adults who receive a stem cell transplant from a donor have been diagnosed with blood cancer. Anthony Nolan also facilitates transplants and supports patients and families who are affected by blood disorders like aplastic anaemia, sickle cell, and thalassemia.

Anthony Nolan is on a mission to grow the stem cell register from just over 900,000 people to one million, to give more patients a better chance of surviving blood cancer and blood disorders.

The charity is calling on people aged 16-30 to sign up to the register, as research shows younger donors lead to more successful transplants. There is a pressing need to recruit more people from diverse backgrounds to the register, to help more patients from minority ethnic backgrounds find the lifesaving matches they need.

2024-09-12,Sep, TfL provides update on ongoing cyber security incident - 12 September,"TfL today (Thursday 12 September) issued an update in relation to the ongoing cyber security incident that it is managing.

Shashi Verma, TfL's Chief Technology Officer, said:

'The security of our systems and customer data is very important to us. We continually monitor who is accessing our systems to ensure only those authorised can gain access.  We identified some suspicious activity on Sunday 1 September and took action to limit access. A thorough investigation continues alongside the National Crime Agency and the National Cyber Security Centre.

'Although there has been very little impact on our customer so far, the situation continues to evolve and our investigations have identified that certain customer data has been accessed. This includes some customer names and contact details (including email addresses and home addresses where provided).

'Some Oyster card refund data may also have been accessed. This could include bank account numbers and sort codes for a limited number of customers. As a precautionary measure, we will be contacting these customers directly as soon as possible to advise them of the support we can provide and the steps they can take.

'We have notified the Information Commissioner's Office and are working at pace with our partners to progress the investigation. We will provide further updates as soon as possible.

'In addition, as part of the measures we have implemented to deal with the cyber incident, we have today put in place additional measures to improve our security. This includes an all-staff IT identity check. Throughout this planned process we have ensured that all safety critical systems and processes have been maintained.

'We do not expect any significant impact to customer journeys as we carry out this process. However, temporary and limited disruption is possible to some services so, as ever, please check before you travel.

'The security measures we are taking mean that it is now not possible for us to deliver the necessary system changes to enable 47 additional stations outside London to benefit from pay as you go with contactless on 22 September as planned. We are working with DfT and the Rail Delivery Group to reschedule and we apologise for the delay.

'We will continue to keep our customers and our staff updated. I would like to apologise for the inconvenience this incident may cause customers and I thank everyone for their patience as we respond to this incident.'",0.19540349644358368,Thu,0.96,1.18,1.05,1.01,NA,NA,0.92,0.94,0.84,0.9986130374479889,0.9855233853006681,0.9993654822335026,0.9980237154150198,NA,NA,1.032934131736527,0.9690721649484536,0.9662576687116564,1.0154373927958833,1.010122042917462,1.0140293637846656,1.0161794697484705,NA,NA,1.0675029400235203,0.9838044308632543,0.9808233188442853

Sensitively restored shopfronts, art deco features and Edwardian architecture have brought back the Arcade's former glory, which is located next to the Victoria bus station and mainline Victoria Station
Places for London, Transport for London's property company, will be investing £300m to improve and enhance its retail offering across London over the next 10 years, including a focus on net zero 
Places for London, Transport for London's property company,  has reopened the Victoria Station Arcade ready for customers to enjoy the restored Edwardian architecture and new retail offer.

Built in the early 1900s as part of the Metropolitan District Railway, the Victoria Station Arcade's unique heritage features had become damaged over time. However, as part of a £1.5m restoration project, skilled craftspeople have sensitively restore heritage mouldings, stonework, plasterwork and installed sympathetic Edwardian-style shopfronts, which replicated the two original remaining shopfronts, and period-style lighting as well as the redecoration of the arcade in a historic District Railway colour scheme.

Father and son architect duo George and Frank Sherrin designed Victoria and other station arcades including Liverpool Street and South Kensington in the 1900s, which are still in use today. However, the Victoria Arcade fell into decline in the 1970s and many of the original architectural features were removed.  Historic England gave the arcade Grade II listed status in 2014, with restoration work beginning a few years later.

Customers who visit the Arcade will be able to enjoy restored features such as the 1920s concrete canopy on Victoria Street and the 1930s London Transport bronze and blue enamel framed panels. Replicas of the twin armed globe luminaires on both facades were also created using examples from London Transport Museum's collection and with the expert support of specialist railway lighting supplier Fain Redfern of Worcester and Decorlight Limited of Telford.  As part of the restoration, one of the shopfronts has also retained its 1930 art deco sunburst glasswork.

Over the next 10 years, Places for London will be investing over £300m towards upgrading, expanding and working towards net zero across its retail spaces.  Ninety-five per cent of retail businesses on Places for London's retail estate are small to medium enterprises, highlighting the unique opportunity available to smaller businesses of partnering with Places for London across its busy estate.  Places for London is supporting the revival of retail across the capital, helping independents and a range of small to mainstream businesses to thrive in London.

The Victoria Station Arcade will be one of two Open House London events TfL is hosting later in September. On 21 September, talks on its history will be given at the arcade every half hour, letting Londoners learn more about its history.

The Arcade has seven retail units, the first of which have new tenants who started to trade earlier in the summer, with more retailers opening their doors soon. 

Samantha Bain-Mollison, Places for London's Head of Retail, said: 

'We are proud to be bringing new life to the arcade and we look forward to seeing visitors enjoy this unique retail offer in the heart of Victoria.

Our work to restore heritage aspects of this historic location is testament to Places for London's dedication to celebrate the city's transport history and provide London's visitors, workers and residents with authentic and thriving retail destinations which can continue to be a part of the capital's future.'",0.26978745675595006,Wed,0.97,1.21,1.07,1.02,NA,NA,0.92,1.01,0.9,1.0090152565880721,1.0105790645879733,1.0184010152284264,1.007905138339921,NA,NA,1.032934131736527,1.041237113402062,1.035276073619632,1.0260148656375072,1.035803111805194,1.0333442088091354,1.0262406526172672,NA,NA,1.0675029400235203,1.057066462948816,1.0508821273331628
2024-09-20,Sep, London celebrates World Car Free Day with local events and around 200 Play Streets,"Communities will be marking World Car Free Day between Friday 20 September and Sunday 22 September with events across the capital

London Play is offering play equipment to participating streets, which will close to enable neighbours to come together 
Stations along what will become the London Overground Windrush line will join the celebrations, including a DJ session at Dalston Junction station  
The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, Transport for London (TfL) and London Play are encouraging Londoners to mark World Car Free Day on Sunday 22 September, as around 200 streets across the capital will be transformed into temporary spaces for play and social gatherings this weekend.

Local streets across London will become play streets between Friday 20 September and Sunday 22 September, enabling thousands of Londoners to play, walk, cycle and spend time with their neighbours. London Play is offering participating streets play equipment, including free space hoppers, and one neighbourhood in Wandsworth has won a mini-carnival event, including an on-street 'Karnival Kart' building workshop and parade.

Stations along what will soon become the London Overground Windrush line will also join the celebrations, and amongst the activities is a carnival-themed DJ set at Dalston Junction station. Hackney Council is also getting into the carnival spirit as the Hackney Carnival returns following a five-year absence on Sunday 22 September. Locals will be able to enjoy a free, family-focused street parade featuring Hackney's carnival groups that celebrate the borough's diverse communities.

In Hounslow, the Council is hosting a guided cycle ride of the newly opened stretch of Cycleway 9 on Friday 20 September to give people the chance to enjoy a guided ride of the new route between Watermans Park and Alexandra Road in Brentford. The event runs from 15:00 to 17:00 on Friday 20 September at Watermans Park. There will be activities for visitors of all ages to enjoy, including games and safety tips. The Cycleway celebration event heralds the start of a weekend of active travel action in the borough. On Sunday 22 September, Hounslow Council and its partners will be taking over a section of Hounslow High Street between 13:00 and 16:00 to celebrate Car Free Day.

Walking and Cycling Commissioner, Will Norman, said: ""World Car Free Day is an important moment to celebrate the progress we've made in building more liveable neighbourhoods, and embracing a different vision for our streets. The Mayor and I are delighted to once again be supporting the activation of play streets on Car Free Day, a unique opportunity to transform streets into playful and social spaces where the whole community can come together to scoot, bike, walk, space hop and socialise safely.""

Emma Strain, Customer Director at TfL, said: ""Londoners of all ages should join the fun and enjoy car free streets across London this weekend. Customers travelling on what will become the London Overground Windrush line will also see Dalston Junction station join the carnival-themed celebrations as well.""

Fiona Sutherland, director at London Play, said: ""London Play is delighted to be helping residents across the capital experience their streets as places for playful community interaction this Car Free Day. Even temporarily, seeing what happens when the cars stop can prompt a powerful shift in people's perceptions about the potential uses of street space. Neighbours meet informally and swap stories. 

""Children cycle down their own street for the first time. Laughter rings out. Why have we prioritised cars, parked or moving, over people? How much have we all lost by retreating from that 'common ground' outside our homes? Car Free Day brings these questions to the surface.""

Once Londoners have enjoyed the experience of seeing their street in a new light - as valuable community space - it is hoped that many will contact their local councils to ask if their street is suitable for regular play street sessions. Play streets contribute to tackling isolation and improving mental health in London's communities, improving air quality, reducing road danger and inspiring more Londoners of all ages to get active as part of their daily lives through walking and cycling.

2024-09-23,Sep, New ticket hall at Paddington Tube station gives direct step-free access to the Bakerloo line,"Paddington Tube station's new Bakerloo line ticket hall is open to customers, providing direct step-free access from street to platform via two lifts 
 
 




 ""The hugely improved ticket hall at Paddington Tube station will transform the journeys of millions of our Bakerloo line customers, making their journeys quicker, easier and more comfortable""
 
 Alex Williams
 Chief Customer and Strategy Officer at TfL
 


 
As part of the Renzo Piano-designed Paddington Square, the new ticket hall is set to transform the experience of customers using the Bakerloo line at Paddington, one of London's busiest train stations
Three times the size of the previous ticket hall, it has more than double the previous number of ticket gates to speed up journey times, improved signage, and provides a modern, welcoming entrance for Bakerloo line customers
The ticket hall sits beneath Paddington Square's new landmark 18-storey mixed-use building, in the capital's new work, shopping and dining destination
The new ticket hall at Paddington Tube station which serves the Bakerloo line is now open. It provides Transport for London (TfL) customers with direct, step-free access from street to platform on the Bakerloo line for the first time, via two lifts.

The new ticket hall is part of the Paddington Square development, owned and funded by Great Western Developments Ltd and developed by Sellar, and sits below a landmark 18-storey crystalline building in the shape of a geometric cube, at the centre of a new 1.35-acre public piazza. The new ticket hall's opening provides customers with a welcoming and fully accessible entrance to the Bakerloo line at one of the capital's busiest transport hubs.

At more than three times the size of the previous Bakerloo line ticket hall, the new entrance is set to transform the experience of customers using the Bakerloo line at Paddington. The number of ticket gates has more than doubled from five to 11, to speed up journey times, and improved signage will make navigating the station quicker and easier.

The new entrance will also make it much more convenient for customers with accessibility requirements who previously used the lengthier, indirect step-free route to the Bakerloo line at Paddington Underground station, via the lifts at the Elizabeth line entrance and then the connecting passenger tunnel.

The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said: ""Bringing more step-free access to London's transport network is a key priority, especially at busy hubs. Paddington station is one of London's busiest stations and an historic and vital part of London's transport infrastructure. I want everyone to be able to use it, so I'm delighted that the new ticket hall will give the Bakerloo line direct step-free access for the first time. I'm also excited to see the Paddington Square regeneration plans develop, giving a boost to the local area and helping to build a fairer, greener and more prosperous London for everyone.""

Alex Williams, Chief Customer and Strategy Officer at TfL, said: ""The hugely improved ticket hall at Paddington Tube station will transform the journeys of millions of our Bakerloo line customers, making their journeys quicker, easier and more comfortable. The previous Bakerloo line ticket hall was dated, congested and not fully accessible, so I'm delighted with this wholescale transformation which means we have an entrance fit to serve one of London's fastest growing business and leisure districts for many decades to come. The new ticket hall, which is a clear demonstration of how we can work with developers to transform public services, is also the latest addition to TfL's step-free offering which we are working hard to increase to help create a fairer, more accessible and inclusive transport network.

""More than a third of Underground stations across the capital are step-free and we are actively engaging with local authorities, developers and businesses in other areas of London to identify investment opportunities to improve the accessibility of the Tube network.""

Paddington Square is a mixed-use building of 430,000 sq. ft which includes 350,000 sq. ft of office space (with more than 2,000 people working on site daily across 14 floors), more than 30 retail units and a range of restaurants, in addition to London Underground's new Bakerloo line ticket hall. The new 1.35-acre piazza, which is visible from Paddington Station's main concourse, features the UK's first permanent outdoor public art commissions from internationally acclaimed artists Ugo Rondinone, Pae White, Catherine Yass and The Showroom with Kathrin Bóhm, and provides a transformed entrance to both Paddington Station (for GWR and Heathrow Express services) and TfL's services (including the London Underground's Bakerloo, Circle, District, and Hammersmith & City lines, the Elizabeth line, six bus services and two night bus services).

TfL has recently completed the relocation of National Express airport coach services from Bishop's Bridge Road to Eastbourne Terrace, next to the new Elizabeth line station, creating a fully integrated transport hub at Paddington, and is also working closely with Network Rail on their masterplan for the station. The green travel routes, canals and parks surrounding the station provide attractive options for those choosing active travel, enjoying the area on foot or by bike.

Justin Brand, Asset Director for Great Western Developments, owners of Paddington Square, said: ""The opening of the new, fully accessible Bakerloo line ticket hall marks a major milestone for Paddington Square, owned by Great Western Developments, and for the wider transformation of Paddington as a premier destination for business, leisure, and travel. The new entrance will enhance the connectivity of one of London's busiest transport hubs, offering step-free access and a vastly improved experience for all passengers.

""Paddington Square has not only brought new energy to the area through its architectural significance and public realm but also with its vibrant mix of retail, dining, working and leisure spaces. With over 30 retail units and a range of standout restaurants, Paddington Square is setting a new standard in creating a seamless blend of transportation, work, and lifestyle amenities, making Paddington easier and more enjoyable than ever to navigate and explore.""

James Sellar, Chief Executive of Sellar, said: ""The opening of the new Bakerloo line ticket hall at Paddington marks a significant achievement for both Paddington Square and the wider regeneration of the area. By collaborating with Great Western Developments, Network Rail, and TfL, we have successfully delivered step-free access and relieved congestion at one of London's busiest transport hubs. Paddington Square's new public spaces, retail offerings, and workspaces demonstrate the transformative impact of collaboration with public and private bodies to deliver benefits for all and reinforcing Paddington's role as a vital destination for business and leisure in the capital.""

Kay Buxton, Chief Executive of The Paddington Partnership, said: ""We are delighted to see the results of this significant investment in the Bakerloo line ticket hall, trebling capacity. This is the first time passengers will have direct step-free access from the Bakerloo line platform, to both the street and mainline station. Passengers will be able to exit onto a breath-taking new public space, the magnificent front door that Paddington station deserves, or directly onto Praed Street for buses.""

Sarah Pugh, Chief Executive of Whizz Kidz, said: ""Whizz Kidz is pleased to hear the new Bakerloo line ticket hall at Paddington Station has opened and will give young wheelchair users direct step-free access from the street to the Bakerloo line platforms. Public transport should provide wheelchair users with independent travel for all aspects of life, be it education, work, health, leisure or social, facilitating an active life and full participation within their community."" 

Clive Wood, Lead Regional Policy and Campaigns Manager at Guide Dogs, said: ""The opening of the new Bakerloo line ticket hall at Paddington station is wonderful news.  Having direct step-free access will make accessing Bakerloo line services much more straightforward for many people including guide dog owners who have dogs that have not been trained to use escalators. Having a route that is much easier to navigate will also make using the station easier for blind and partially sighted people.""

The multi-agency team who worked on the construction of the new ticket hall, which is built on the site of a former Royal Mail sorting office and has concrete foundations extending to 26 metres below ground, had to divert a main sewer to reconfigure the previous ticket hall and worked in close proximity to a number of major assets including the existing escalators which continued to serve the Bakerloo line platforms and Mail Rail, the former post office railway.

2024-09-25,Sep, Places for London selects new partner for electric vehicle charging hubs,"New joint venture partnership with Fastned, the award-winning European ultra-rapid charging company, will help deliver multiple electric vehicle charging hubs across TfL's estate, supporting the transition to Net Zero carbon
 
 




 ""Londoners deserve a top-notch EV charging network for all those daily trips and longer journeys""
 
 Tom Hurst
 UK Country Director for Fastned
 


 
First of five initial ultra-rapid charging hubs will be delivered across London from 2026, with at least a further 25 sites in total planned in future years as the joint venture progresses
Subject to approval by TfL's Land and Property Committee, Places for London will form the joint venture with Fastned at the earliest opportunity
Partnership will build on existing work by TfL to grow the capital's electric vehicle charging infrastructure while also helping generate revenue for reinvestment into London's transport network
Places for London - Transport for London's (TfL) property company - has selected Fastned, the award-winning European ultra-rapid charging company, as its preferred partner for its new joint venture (JV) to help develop several new electric vehicle (EV) ultra-rapid charging hubs across its estate.

The joint venture, which will help support the Mayor of London's commitment to achieve Net Zero carbon by 2030, aims to deliver new dedicated off-street urban charging hubs that will be able to simultaneously charge multiple vehicles at high speeds. The sites will also help support placemaking in the local areas by including retail and other facilities, such as toilets on the larger sites where possible. Now the preferred bidder has been selected, Places for London is requesting approval from TfL's Land and Property Committee to form the joint venture at the earliest opportunity. This is expected to occur later this year, with the first site delivered in 2026.

The joint venture intends to be at the forefront of developments in accessibility and safety, with the new charging infrastructure looking to meet or exceed the Public Charge Point Regulations 2023 and deliver best practices from the British Standards Institution's guidance on accessible charging infrastructure. Customer safety will also be prioritised, with all sites designed to provide clear lines of sight, high illuminance lighting and CCTV, as well as on-site presence where additional facilities are provided. These measures will make the infrastructure more accessible and inclusive and will provide a more positive experience for all customers.

Fastned already operates one of London's busiest ultra-rapid charging hubs in Greenwich, which offers electric drivers up to 300 miles of range in as little as 20 minutes. Voted best ultra-rapid charging network in the UK, the Netherlands, France and Belgium, Fastned already operates 25 charging hubs in the UK and more than 325 across Europe. Its network operates with high uptime due to its data-driven, in-house operations and maintenance teams. 24/7 customer support - available in multiple languages - helps customers experiencing any technical issues, while its recognisable solar canopies keep drivers safe and dry while charging. These canopies also make Fastned charging hubs easy to spot and safe to navigate to from the roadside, showing drivers what is available to them.

Across London, there are 180,000 plug-in electric cars and vans already registered in the capital.* With around 21,600 charge points to date, London leads the way with electric vehicle charging infrastructure, with around a third of all EV charging infrastructure across the UK, more than any other UK region.** Working with Fastned, Places for London will establish a long-term delivery plan which will help ensure influence and control in the electric vehicle charging proposition on the TfL estate, while also opening up opportunities for wider collaboration with Places for London's other joint ventures and strategic delivery partners. This flexible approach will also ensure that the electric vehicle proposition being delivered by Places for London can adapt over time in line with best practice for accessibility and charging speeds, as well as technological developments.

In parallel with the procurement process, Places for London have been developing the pipeline of potential EV charging hub sites, to help ensure that the joint venture can start delivering charging hubs as quickly as possible. Early in the process, five initial locations, delivering around 50 bays in total across London, were highlighted to Fastned and other potential partners. Each site has the potential to deliver a minimum of six publicly accessible ultra-rapid charging bays, including at least one bay for those with accessibility needs, which will allow drivers to charge their vehicles in approximately half an hour. The first of the five previously announced sites is expected to start on site during 2025 and open to customers in 2026. Across the life of the joint venture, Places for London hopes to deliver at least 25 hubs across its estate, with the potential to increase this up to 65 hubs as market demand and opportunities arise.

By creating a long-term joint venture, this opportunity will enable Places for London to directly shape the design and delivery of the hubs while generating long-term revenue, which can then be reinvested back into the transport network - further encouraging a shift to more sustainable forms of transport.

Mark Farrow, Director of Strategy and Planning at Places for London, said: ""We are excited to have now selected Fastned as our preferred partner for our new joint venture to bring forward a number of new electric vehicle charging hubs. These hubs will help encourage high-mileage businesses such as taxi, private hire and commercial drivers, across London, to confidently make the transition to electric vehicles.

""These new charging hubs, the first of which will open in 2026, will make it even easier for those who need to rapidly charge their electric vehicles, with several bays at each location, helping London to further work towards the Mayor of London's commitment to achieving Net Zero carbon by 2030.""

Tom Hurst, UK Country Director for Fastned, said: ""Londoners deserve a top-notch EV charging network for all those daily trips and longer journeys. That's why we're excited and proud to be bringing more ultra-rapid charging to key locations across the city - all helping to ramp up London's transition to electric.""

Deputy Mayor for Environment and Energy Mete Coban said: ""We currently have more than 21,000 public electric vehicle charge points in London - over a third of the UK's total charging network -  and the Mayor is committed to working with partners like Fastned to hugely expand that number in the next four years.

""London is leading the way in becoming the electric vehicle capital of the world, as we continue building a greener, fairer and more prosperous London for all.""

Amanda Zambon, Policy Director of the Association of International Courier & Express Services (AICES), said: ""AICES welcomes the announcement that Places for London will be delivering a series of ultra-rapid changing hubs across London from 2026.

Express operators are making large investments in electric vehicles, and the availability of charging bays that can accommodate commercial vehicle requirements is essential to support their deployment and achieve our industry's ambitious decarbonisation goals. We look forward to continuing to work with Places for London as the hubs are rolled out.""

More than 1,200 EV charging points found across the capital are rapid or ultra-rapid charging points. Of these, approximately 300 have been delivered by TfL.***

As part of London's 2030 Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Strategy, December 2021, TfL's modelling predicted that if current demand continues, London will need around 4,000 rapid charge points by 2030. To help achieve this number, TfL is looking at how to bring more of its own land into use for EV charging bays and is working with other members of the Greater London Authority (GLA) family and borough councils to bring further sites across London.

2024-09-26,Sep, Data shows road fatalities reduced four times more in London than rest of Great Britain,"New data comparing 2023 with the 2010-14 baseline shows that fatalities have reduced by 30 per cent in London compared to seven per cent for the rest of Great Britain

 Lilli Matson
 TfL's Chief Safety, Health and Environment Officer
 


 
However, every death and serious injury on the road network is a tragedy and TfL and the Mayor are determined to end the devastation caused by road danger
2023 was the lowest year on record for fatalities in the capital, excluding 2021, where traffic levels were heavily affected by the pandemic lockdowns
In total, the number of people tragically killed or seriously injured on London's roads in 2023 fell by six per cent compared to 2022, from 3,961 to 3,710
Transport for London (TfL) has published its 2023 Casualties in Greater London report that shows when comparing 2023 data with the 2010-14 baseline, fatalities have reduced by 30 per cent (from 136 to 95) in London compared to seven per cent for the rest of Great Britain (from 1,663 to 1,550), and serious injuries have decreased by 24 per cent (from 4,734 to 3,615), compared to a 13 per cent decrease (from 28,007 to 24,383) respectively. [1] However, 95 people were tragically killed on London's roads, with devastating consequences for the families, friends and communities impacted by these deaths and life-changing injuries. Urgent action is still needed and TfL remains committed to working closely with London's boroughs, the police and other partners to carry out the work needed to reduce danger on London's roads for everyone.

In total, the number of people tragically killed or seriously injured on London's roads in both inner and outer London in 2023 fell by six per cent compared to 2022, from 3,961 to 3,710.

Compared to the 2010-14 baseline, nearly all London boroughs have seen a decrease in the number of people killed or seriously injured. Islington has achieved the largest decrease in inner London (from 175 to 98) at 44 per cent, and Waltham Forest has achieved the largest decrease in outer London (from 119 to 63) at 47 per cent. [2]

Last year was also the lowest year on record for fatalities in the capital, excluding 2021, which was heavily affected by pandemic-related lockdowns and changes in travel patterns. [3] This marks important progress towards the Mayor's Vision Zero goal of eliminating death and serious injury from London's streets by 2041.

The report also shows the likelihood of being killed or injured on London's roads by mode of transport:

Motorcycles are the riskiest mode of travel and motorcyclists were 15 times more likely to be killed on London's roads in a collision in 2022, per journey, than the average for all listed transport modes. This equates to one motorcyclist killed for every 5.6 million motorcycle journeys, a fatality risk rate of 0.18 per million journeys.  
The two next highest fatality risk modes are pedestrians (one pedestrian killed for every 60 million pedestrian journeys, a rate of 0.017) and cyclists (one cyclist killed for every 62 million cyclist journeys, a rate of 0.016).  
By contrast bus or coach occupants are the least at risk of being killed, with one bus or coach passenger killed for every 867 million bus/coach occupant journeys in 2022 (a rate of 0.001). [4]
However, the risk of a motorcyclist being killed on London's roads is now less than half of what it was compared to the 2010-2014 baseline period (from 0.40 to 0.18 per million journeys). The number of people killed while cycling has also fallen by 40 per cent against the 2010-14 baseline, from 13 to eight. Data shows that cycling journeys have continued to increase with the number of daily cycle journeys increasing to 1.26 million in 2023, up by 6.3 per cent since 2022 from 1.18 million. [5]

Cars continued to be the vehicle type most frequently involved in a fatal collision (43 out of the 94 fatal collisions). Speeding remains one of the biggest risks to road users, with around half of the 2023 fatal collisions in London reporting speed as a contributory factor. [6] TfL continues to work on lowering speeds across London, and last year lowered the speed limit on selected roads in 14 boroughs, exceeding its target to lower the speed limit on 140km of roads by March 2024. There are now 264km of TfL roads that are subject to a 20mph speed limit. TfL is also working closely with the police to increase their capacity to take enforcement action against drivers and riders who speed, given the risk and harm it causes. The Met is currently on target to be able to take action on a million speeding offences by the end of 24/25. In 2023/24, more than 800,000 speeding offences were enforced [7].

Lilli Matson, TfL's Chief Safety, Health and Environment Officer said: ""It's encouraging to see that we're making real progress in London to achieve our Vision Zero goal of eliminating death and serious injury from the transport network. However, we know there is much more work to do to achieve this goal. It's important that we continue to work together with all our partners to incorporate road safety into every decision we make as without safe streets we know that people won't choose the most healthy and sustainable modes of transport. Vision Zero is an essential part of building a better London for everyone and we are determined to make London a greener, more sustainable and safer city.""

The Walking and Cycling Commissioner, Will Norman said: ""Every death or serious injury on our streets is a tragedy and we are determined to achieve the Mayor's goal of eliminating them from our streets."" 

""The Mayor and I are committed to making it safer and easier to get around the capital, and this work includes implementing safer speeds in boroughs, tightening the Direct Vision Safety standard for HGVs and delivering high-quality cycle and pedestrian infrastructure across the city. This vital work is helping to build a better, greener and safer London for everyone.""

TfL continues to work in partnership with the boroughs, police and other stakeholders to directly tackle road danger and continues to work on a number of major programmes to make London's roads and the vehicles using them safer. TfL's world-first Direct Vision Standard, which reduces lethal blind spots on lorries, is already helping to save lives and prevent life-changing injuries [7]. From October 2024, TfL will be enhancing DVS requirements with all HGVs over 12 tonnes required to have a three-star rating or fit Progressive Safe System measures to operate in Greater London. TfL has also continued to work on its Safer Junctions programme to make life-saving changes at some of the capital's most dangerous and intimidating junctions. TfL has so far completed work at 45 junctions across London as part of the programme, with works at Battersea Bridge and Lambeth Bridge due to start later this year.",0.32090782118705813,Thu,0.95,1.18,1.04,1,NA,NA,0.92,0.96,0.86,0.9882108183079057,0.9855233853006681,0.9898477157360407,0.9881422924901185,NA,NA,1.032934131736527,0.9896907216494846,0.9892638036809817,1.0048599199542596,1.010122042917462,1.0043719412724306,1.0061182868796736,NA,NA,1.0675029400235203,1.0047364400305576,1.0041762550072444
2024-09-26,Sep, TfL teams up with Go Jauntly to launch six walks linked to the new London Overground line names,"New themed walks launched on the Go Jauntly app, celebrating the new lines and the stories behind them

 Customer Director at TfL
 


 
Later this year, the new line names and colours will be rolled out across the London Overground network
Londoners can now enjoy six fascinating self-guided walks to help celebrate the new London Overground line names that will be rolled out across the network later this year. The walks, developed in partnership with community-based walking app Go Jauntly, helps participants to delve into the stories behind each of the line names and visit points of interest while encouraging them to stay active.

Those enjoying the Lioness Walk will be able to take in the delights of Wembley Park and Wembley Stadium, while on the Mildmay line walk you can visit the original site of the Mildmay Hospital and some points of interest that have played an important part to the LGBTQIA+ community both in the past and present. 

The Liberty line walk helps people delve into the history of the area, which was once a site of a former palace, and make the most of the abundant green spaces in the borough. It's Windrush line counterpart encourages people to visit areas synonymous with African and Caribbean communities and culture including the much-cherished Ridley Road market. 

Those who choose the Weaver line walk will be able to visit the UK's oldest trading market and the former Bangladeshi leather markets of the East End to learn how communities helped to establish the craft of weaving and tapestry into textiles.

Will Norman, London's Walking and Cycling Commissioner, was joined by Unmesh Desai MP and Assembly Member Anne Clarke last Friday to check out part of the walk dedicated to the Suffragette line ahead of the official launch.  This walk takes in key points of interest such as the Women's Museum, England's only museum dedicated to women, and Hampstead Town Hall Centre, a regular Suffragette meeting point. 

The free Go Jauntly app provides walkers access to these high-quality walking routes, along with helpful walking tips, walk inspirations and motivational reminders.  Customers can access the walks by downloading the Go Jauntly app from the Apple or Play Stores or by clicking here. 

Walking and Cycling Commissioner, Will Norman, said: ""These new London Overground-themed walking routes are a great opportunity for Londoners to learn more about the history behind the new line names while staying active and enjoying the sights of London. 

""The new names and colours, launching later this year, will make the Overground easier to navigate, while celebrating the diversity of London's heritage and communities."" 

Emma Strain, Customer Director at TfL, said: ""These six new London Overground themed walks not only help customers delve into the history of the new line names, but also helps them stay active. We hope customers take the opportunity to get out and explore the fascinating stories behind each of the line names with the help of Go Jauntly."" 

Hana Sutch, CEO & Co-Founder at Go Jauntly, said: ""It's been incredible to dive into the history and background of each of the London Overground line themes. From the stories of Windrush heroes to equality pioneers in the LGBTQIA+ community to female emancipation legends and elite sportswomen, we're thrilled to bring to life these fascinating stories on these beautiful new walking tours. There are some really trailblazing people we'd never heard of before and will now never forget. Do head out to walk these new London walks to find out more!"" 

Each of the London's six London Overground lines for the first time even be given a unique name and line colour.  This significant change, which will include a major update to London's world-famous Tube map, will make it easier for customers to navigate London's transport network while also celebrating the city's diverse culture and history. 

Each route will be represented by a new line name and colour on the Tube map, on train line diagrams, at stations and on digital journey planning tools, such as TfL Go.  The much-loved orange roundel will continue to be used across the London Overground network. 

The new line names are:  

The Lioness line: Euston to Watford Junction. The Lioness line, which runs through Wembley, honours the historic achievements and lasting legacy created by the England women's football team that continues to inspire and empower the next generation of women and girls in sport. It will be yellow parallel lines on the map.  

The Mildmay line: Stratford to Richmond/Clapham Junction. The Mildmay line, which runs through Hoxton, honours the small charitable hospital in Shoreditch that has cared for Londoners over many years, notably its pivotal role in the HIV/AIDS crisis in the 1980s, which made it the valued and respected place it is for the LGBTQ+ community today. It will be blue parallel lines on the map.  

The Windrush line: Highbury & Islington to Clapham Junction/New Cross/Crystal Palace/West Croydon. The Windrush line runs through areas with strong ties to Caribbean communities today, such as Dalston Junction, Peckham Rye and West Croydon and honours the Windrush generation who continue to shape and enrich London's cultural and social identity today. It will be red parallel lines on the map.  

The Weaver line: Liverpool Street to Cheshunt/Enfield Town/Chingford. The Weaver line runs through Liverpool Street, Spitalfields, Bethnal Green and Hackney - areas of London known for their textile trade, shaped over the centuries by diverse migrant communities and individuals. It will be maroon parallel lines on the map.     

The Suffragette line: Gospel Oak to Barking Riverside. The Suffragette line celebrates how the working-class movement in the East End, fought for votes for woman and paved the way for women's rights. The line runs to Barking, home of the longest surviving Suffragette Annie Huggett, who died at 103. It will be green parallel lines on the map.    

The Liberty line: Romford to Upminster. The Liberty line celebrates the freedom that is a defining feature of London and references the historical independence of the people of Havering, through which it runs. It will be grey parallel lines on the map.",0.2913773349560107,Thu,0.95,1.18,1.04,1,NA,NA,0.92,0.96,0.86,0.9882108183079057,0.9855233853006681,0.9898477157360407,0.9881422924901185,NA,NA,1.032934131736527,0.9896907216494846,0.9892638036809817,1.0048599199542596,1.010122042917462,1.0043719412724306,1.0061182868796736,NA,NA,1.0675029400235203,1.0047364400305576,1.0041762550072444
2024-09-30,Sep, TfL appoints tunnelling contractor for Elephant & Castle Tube station upgrade,"TfL awards multi-million-pound contract to Dragados UK to design and construct new passenger tunnels linking the new station box, the concrete box-like structure the station is in below ground, with the existing Northern line platforms and overbridge
 
 




 ""I'm delighted TfL has now appointed a tunnelling contractor so work can continue on the vital Elephant and Castle Tube station upgrade, which will give the station step free access for the first time and deliver a new Northern line entrance and ticket hall""
 
 Seb Dance
 Deputy Mayor for Transport
 


 
Vital station upgrade will deliver step-free access to the Northern line for the first time, along with a much-needed new Northern line entrance and ticket hall
It will also support long-term growth across the Elephant & Castle Opportunity Area to meet the projected 25-40 per cent increase in demand for services from the station by 2041 (compared to pre-pandemic levels)
The upgraded station will support the delivery of more than 10,000 new jobs and 5,000 new homes, with at least 1,650 affordable
It will also be the first piece of substantial infrastructure to support the proposed Bakerloo Line Extension
Transport for London (TfL) has awarded a contract to Dragados UK for the design and construction of new passenger tunnels at Elephant & Castle Tube station, which will link the new station box to the existing platforms and overbridge. The contract award is the latest development in the vital capacity upgrade project and follows a competitive tendering process. 

The first stage of the major upgrade of Elephant & Castle Tube station, which includes the tunnelling work, is funded by the Greater London Authority (GLA), London Borough of Southwark (LBS) and contributions from local developers. Work on excavating around 135m of new passenger tunnels will start next year and is due to be completed in 2027. 

The ongoing work to build the expanded Elephant & Castle Tube station, which is essential for the regeneration of the area, includes:  

The construction of a new station box and passenger tunnels which will link the box to the existing platforms and overbridge (Stage 1). In January 2022 construction started on the station box, a reinforced concrete structure that will house the new Northern line entrance and ticket hall. The team celebrated excavating to the lowest level - 33m below ground - in March this year. The station box will also support a new oversite development, including the new campus for UAL's London College of Communication.
The fit-out of the new station box, enabling a new, larger Northern line entrance and ticket hall, with step-free access, to be brought into use (Stage 2). It will be integrated with the Elephant & Castle shopping centre redevelopment currently under construction and replace the existing Northern line entrance and ticket hall which will be decommissioned, ready for further redevelopment. Stage 2 is subject to funding approval.
Future proofing for the Bakerloo Line Extension. The new Northern line entrance and ticket hall will represent the first piece of substantial infrastructure to support the proposed Bakerloo Line Extension, which is currently unfunded. If funding is secured, the extension would connect Elephant & Castle to Lewisham via Old Kent Road and New Cross Gate, unlocking 20,000 homes, creating 10,000 jobs and delivering a £1.5bn boost to the UK economy*. The new entrance and ticket hall would initially improve capacity for Northern line customers but is being constructed in such a way that it could serve both Northern and Bakerloo line customers in future.
Deputy Mayor for Transport, Seb Dance, said: ""I'm delighted TfL has now appointed a tunnelling contractor so work can continue on the vital Elephant and Castle Tube station upgrade, which will give the station step free access for the first time and deliver a new Northern line entrance and ticket hall. These significant upgrades will not only improve customer journeys through the station but will also support the delivery of thousands of new jobs and new homes in Elephant and Castle, supporting the Mayor's aim for a fairer, greener London for everyone."" 

Stuart Harvey, TfL's Chief Capital Officer, said: ""Work is progressing well on the major upgrade of Elephant & Castle Tube station, with the appointment of a tunnelling contractor a significant step forward in delivering an expanded station fit to serve this growing community for many decades to come. When completed, the new entrance and ticket hall will provide step-free access from street to platform level on the Northern line and increase station capacity by over 30 per cent. Further in the future, and subject to TfL securing the necessary funding, the plan is for this new entrance to also serve Bakerloo line customers as part of the planned Bakerloo Line Extension."" 

Cllr Helen Dennis, Cabinet Member for New Homes and Sustainable Development at Southwark Council, said: ""Elephant and Castle is fast-growing as a busy town centre and popular place to live in Zone 1, which needs a station that can meet increasing demand. This new entrance and ticket hall is essential for easier access to the Northern line for residents and visitors, while paving the way for a future extension of the Bakerloo line. It's really exciting to see major progress on a project that will help transform our city with new homes, jobs, and growth."" 

TfL is progressing work on plans to upgrade and extend the Bakerloo line. TfL's immediate priority is securing the long-term capital funding certainty that would allow it to, among other vital investments, replace the existing 36-train Bakerloo line fleet which, at over 50 years old, is the oldest operating in daily passenger service anywhere in the UK. Securing a new fleet of trains, which the Siemens Mobility factory in Goole would be expected to deliver, and signalling for the Bakerloo line would improve reliability across the line. Although currently unfunded, an extension of the Bakerloo line to Lewisham and beyond would provide a radical change in connectivity and capacity, unlocking much needed new homes and supporting jobs and economic growth both across London and more widely across the UK via TfL's extensive supply chain. The upgrade of the Bakerloo line is necessary to support the extension, which is safeguarded and ready to take through the planning process.",0.2775706022906935,Mon,0.96,1.21,1.06,1.01,NA,NA,0.87,0.97,0.87,0.9986130374479889,1.0105790645879733,1.0088832487309645,0.9980237154150198,NA,NA,0.9767964071856287,1,1.0007668711656441,1.0154373927958833,1.035803111805194,1.0236867862969006,1.0161794697484705,NA,NA,1.0094864758918072,1.0152024446142094,1.015852723088724
2024-09-30,Sep, TfL promotes Priority Seating Week with DLR trial and children’s art competition,"TfL's Priority Seating Week is a dedicated week of action to raise awareness of priority seats across the public transport network
 
 



 
School children across the capital encouraged to bring Priority Seating Week to life with creative artwork, with three lucky winners receiving tickets to a Merlin Entertainments attraction in London
New signage designs will be trialled on DLR trains to highlight priority seats, and encourage people to look up and give their seat to someone who may need it more
More than 140,000 'Please offer me a seat' badges have been issued since they launched in 2017
Transport for London (TfL) is encouraging school children across the capital to express their creative talents and design a piece of artwork to mark the start of Priority Seating Week.

TfL provides priority seating to help customers, including those with non-visible conditions, parents with infants as well as older people to travel more safely and comfortably. There are designated priority seats in every train and tram carriage and on buses. They are normally found close to doors and should be clearly signposted.

The art competition*, which is open to children aged six to 14, calls for budding artists to submit photographs of an artwork they have created depicting why it is important for people to offer seats to people who need them. Children have until 17 November to apply, and entries will be judged by TfL's Independent Disability Advisory Group. Three lucky winners will see their artwork displayed on London's transport network and will receive tickets for a family of four to a Merlin Entertainments attraction in London, and three runners up will receive return tickets for a family of four for the IFS Cloud Cable Car.

TfL will also be marking the week by trialling new signage and designs on DLR trains, to highlight priority seat locations and encourage people to look up and offer their seat. This is in addition to the ongoing 'Access DLR' accessibility assistance trial** for customers who would like additional travel support on their journey.

TfL's customer inclusion plan, Equity in Motion, which was published in February, set out more than 80 commitments to make London a fairer and more accessible and inclusive city. One of these commitments was to conduct research into priority seating with a panel of disabled customers, and this was undertaken earlier this year.

The research looked at how likely people are to get a priority seat if they need one and showed that many of those who need a seat do get one. It also revealed that although many customers are doing the right thing and offering their seat, it is not always clear when someone needs a priority seat and people are not always paying attention to their surroundings to notice if there is someone in need of a seat. Separate research for the Docklands Light Railway (DLR) also showed that many people were unaware of the priority seating, which are not visually distinctive from other seating.

TfL's Priority Seating Week aims to help tackle this issue by raising awareness of the availability of priority seating across the public transport network and the importance of customers giving up their seat to other passengers who may be in a greater need.

There will be engagement activity throughout the week in stations and new posters across the transport network, as well as posts on social media.

Station staff on the Elizabeth line will promote TfL's 'Please offer me a seat' badge to make travelling easier and more comfortable for people with a range of needs and conditions who find it difficult to stand for the duration of their journeys.

Since its launch in 2017, more than 140,000 'Please offer me a seat' badges have been issued to disabled people and those with non-visible conditions. TfL has also issued more than 800,000 'Baby on board' badges in the last eight years alone following its launch in 2005. On the DLR network, customers can for the first time find both badges at staffed stations*** and the London City Airport information centre.

Seb Dance, Deputy Mayor for Transport, said:

'Making the public transport network accessible for all is a top priority for the Mayor, and Londoners can play their part by being aware of who's around them and offering their seat to those who need it, bearing in mind that not all disabilities are visible.

'I'm pleased to see TfL taking an innovative approach this Priority Seating Week, trialling new signage designs on DLR trains which will clearly highlight priority seats.'

Mark Evers, Transport for London's Chief Customer Officer, said:

'It is vital that we ensure that everyone can travel comfortably and safely, especially for those who might require more assistance. Travelling around London has been made easier for thousands of people thanks to our 'Please offer me a seat' and 'Baby on board' badges.

'We know from our research that there is still more we can do to make priority seats more visible and to encourage people to offer their seats to people who may need them. Our trial of new priority seating signage on the DLR, station engagement activity and art competition all aim to support this and inspire travellers to be kind and considerate to others.'

Joanna Wootten, Chair of TfL's Independent Disability Advisory Group (IDAG), said:

'IDAG knows how important seats, including priority seats, are for many disabled and older people in enabling them to travel and enjoy life in London.

'Priority Seating Week is a great initiative, and we are pleased it continues every year to highlight this whilst encouraging people to give up their seat for those who need it more.  We're excited by the competition and are looking forward to seeing the winning children's artwork on display. The children's posters will help to raise awareness of the importance of offering a seat to people who may need one, including people with non-visible conditions.'

Sunny Jouhal, Divisional Director for Merlin Entertainments' Gateway UK attractions, said:

'Merlin Entertainments is proud to partner with TfL during Priority Seating Week for this competition and offer family tickets as prizes to our London attractions, which are all fully accessible.

'Accessibility is a key priority for us at Merlin and we are committed to continue investing in facilities and training to make sure we create magical and memorable experiences for all our guests.'

Other accessibility commitments within TfL's Equity in Motion plan include:

Meeting the Mayor's ambitious goal of making half of all Tube stations step-free by 2030
Introducing mini ramps to cover the gap between the train and platform at all London Underground platforms that are step-free to train
Launching an innovation challenge aimed at improving travel for disabled people
More dedicated spaces for wheelchair users and buggies created on Bakerloo, Central and Waterloo & City line trains
Publishing a study into how TfL will increase customer toilet provision
Installing priority seating moquettes to 1,000 Routemaster buses by 2025
Ensuring all frontline staff complete disability equality training
To enter the competition, children should email a picture of their artwork to PrioritySeatingComp@tfl.gov.uk before Sunday 17 November for a chance to win.

In episode five of TfL's Mind the Gap Overground podcast, presenter Tim Dunn speaks with chef Levi Roots, former Dragons' Den contestant and founder of Reggae Reggae Sauce, and Arthur Torrington, co-founder of the Windrush Foundation
TfL will also mark Black History Month with an exhibition by the Windrush Foundation at Dalston Junction station and a photography series celebrating black staff members
Transport for London is marking Black History Month with the release of the Windrush episode of the successful Mind the Gap podcast series about the inspiration behind the new names for the London Overground lines.

In this episode, presenter Tim Dunn delves into the fascinating history of the Windrush generation and its links to the London Overground line that runs from Highbury & Islington to Clapham Junction, New Cross, Crystal Palace and West Croydon, with special guests Levi Roots and Arthur Torrington. The line will become the Windrush line later this year.

The Windrush line will be represented on the Tube map with two parallel red lines, as part of the new names and colours for each of the six London Overground lines, making it easier for customers to navigate London's transport network while also celebrating the city's diverse culture and history.

In episode five of the Mind the Gap podcast, presenter Tim Dunn visits Peckham Rye in south-east London, where he speaks with Arthur Torrington. Arthur is advocate and co-founder of the Windrush Foundation. During the interview he talks about the impact of former Councillor Sam Beaver King MBE who served in the RAF for King and country before being sent back to Jamacia and later returning to England on the Empire Windrush.

Councillor King was the first person to commemorate the ship in 1968 when he put an advert in the local newspaper inviting those that came across on the ship to contact him. A few short years later King had a successful broadcast career before becoming the first black Mayor of Southwark. King set up the Windrush Foundation, with Arthur Torrington in 1996 to preserve the memories of those who arrived on that voyage and to campaign on behalf of West Indian immigrants.

In the second part of the episode, Tim speaks with former Dragons' Den contestant Levi Roots at Clapham Junction station. Levi talks about leaving his home in Clarendon in Jamacia to playing reggae music in The Providence Club in Clapham in his late teens, and after several years as a musician, he speaks about his journey into the food industry and his success with Reggae Reggae Sauce and his Dragons' Den triumph.

To help prepare customers ahead of the launch of the London Overground Windrush line later this year, The Windrush Foundation is hosting a special exhibition at Dalston Junction until the 10 October to highlight the contribution that the Windrush generation has made to UK public services, the arts and commerce.

Deputy Mayor for Transport, Seb Dance, said:

'The Windrush line, one of the six new London Overground line names chosen to highlight London's diverse history, honours the Windrush generation and their descendants who have contributed so much to our great city.

'I'm delighted that everyone can now learn more about this movement through TfL's Mind the Gap podcast, and I also encourage Londoners to check out the Windrush Foundation's special exhibition at Dalston Junction station which explores the history of Windrush.'

Emma Strain, Customer Director at TfL, said:

'The London Overground Windrush line honours the Windrush generation who continue to shape and enrich London's cultural and social identity today.

'We hope that our new podcast episode with Arthur Torrington and Levi Roots will inspire our customers to find out more about the fascinating history of the Windrush Generation. The Windrush Generation will always have close links to Transport for London and the exhibition at Dalston Junction is a wonderful way to highlight their contributions to public transport over several decades.'

Levi Roots, speaking on the Mind the Gap podcast, said:

'When I ride on the Windrush line for the first time, I will be shedding a tear. It will be fantastic for people to be able to ride on the London Overground and be able to say that they are travelling with the wonderful, iconic story of Windrush that needs to be told in this country.'

Arthur Torrington, speaking on the Mind the Gap podcast, said:

'The whole idea about the Windrush line is a brilliant idea, it's a game-changer. It helps not only the community along which the line runs, but it helps people who use the London Overground to understand and learn more about the history of Windrush. Knowing that history is a benefit to society - it helps community understanding, social cohesion, cultural exchange, and the best way of living.'

TfL is also marking Black History Month with a photography series of black staff members at Victoria station which is running over the autumn.

On the first Thursday of each month the Horniman Museum in Forest Hill is open to visitors until 21:00. October's Late includes Forging Ahead - A Celebration of the African and Caribbean Diaspora Legacy, two artistic documentary films celebrating the legacies of the African and Caribbean diaspora communities in Britain. This will be followed by a Q&A panel with the storytellers and creatives involved in the films.

The final episodes of the Mind the Gap London Overground series will delve into the stories of Weaver line later this autumn.

The 'Mind the Gap' podcast series was produced by 18Sixty and is released today on all major podcast platforms. ",0.264676264213863,Tue,0.95,1.21,1.05,1.01,NA,NA,0.97,0.97,0.87,0.9978991596638656,1.0151006711409396,0.9974667511082964,1.0073138297872342,NA,NA,1.0923423423423424,0.9891230455472467,0.9923954372623573,1.0048599199542596,1.035803111805194,1.0140293637846656,1.0161794697484705,NA,NA,1.1255194041552332,1.0152024446142094,1.015852723088724
2024-10-02,Oct, Green-fingered staff bring Tube and rail stations and depots into full bloom,"TfL announces the winners of its hotly contested annual 'In Bloom' competition, which is open to all staff

 Emma Strain
 TfL's Customer Director
 


 
Green-fingered staff across London's transport network transformed parts of stations and depots including walls, tables and entire platforms into colourful gardens of flowers, fruits, vegetables and air-purifying plants 
Aligning with the Mayor of London and TfL's commitment to help protect and improve the environment, these gardens promote sustainability and contribute to the well-being of millions of Londoners and visitors to the capital 
The winners of Transport for London's (TfL) hotly contested staff gardening competition ""In Bloom"" recognises the variety of gardens that flourish on London's transport network. With awards in a range of categories - from indoor gardens and hanging baskets to larger cultivated gardens - the In Bloom competition inspires gardeners from across TfL, with some even enlisting the help of customers.

Green-fingered staff from across the city innovatively used spaces across stations, depots and offices to develop gardens which provide beautiful scenery and fresh produce.

Northwick Park Underground station bagged this year's 'Gardens of The Future' theme award, by planting adaptable, sustainable and edible plants which provides a model for maximising small green spaces across the transport network.

Upminster Depot won both the 'Best in Show' and 'Best Newcomer' Awards. Over a few months, the staff transformed a patch of disused space into a garden that incorporates a seating area, wildflower meadow and art on the portacabins and office walls.

The In Bloom competition was first started in 1910 by the District Railway. TfL and its enthusiastic staff, often working with local residents and businesses have kept this century-old tradition alive. This year saw more than 60 entries from across the city - West Croydon to Croxley and Upminster to West Ruislip.

Seb Dance, Deputy Mayor for Transport, said:

'Climate change is a very real threat to all of us, and this year's In Bloom competition had sustainability firmly at its core.

'The winners of In Bloom truly harnessed this message, creating unique and beautiful gardens which will brighten Londoners' journeys while reminding us of importance of looking after our planet and adapting to the effects of climate change.'

Emma Strain, TfL's Customer Director, said:

'London's Tube and rail stations have been bursting with colour over the summer as our staff have been creating vibrant gardens for our In Bloom gardening competition. These not only brighten up local communities and customer's journeys everyday they help to tackle climate change. The standard of the entries this year was tremendous, and we'd like to thank everyone involved for their efforts.'

Sue Buck, Art in Bloom award winner and Customer Service Supervisor at TfL, said:

'The annual In Bloom competition is a wonderful way for staff to express themselves, and I have really enjoyed working with my colleagues to create these beautiful spaces across the transport network.'

Winners in the other categories are as follows: 

'Hainault Train Crew Accommodation' (TCA) won the John Knight Award for Best Tubs, Hanging Baskets and Window Boxes. Their garden at the entrance to the office provided a warm welcome to train operators starting their shifts
Morden Underground station secured the 'Fruits and Vegetables Award' and impressed the judges with the sheer variety of produce, including pineapple lemons and limes
South Tottenham Overground station won in the 'Cultivated Gardens' (station) category. Their expansion of their garden on an otherwise blank embankment and work with local schools and pensioners created a blend of enhanced atmosphere and community engagement
Hammersmith Service Control Centre were triumphant in the 'Cultivated Gardens' (depot) category. Their garden's continued growth and the opportunity for staff to get involved by sponsoring trees or borrowing from the tree library made their entry really stood out
London Underground office Abrams House in High Barnet came first in the 'Indoor Gardens' category. The staff used plants to liven up the train crew accommodation office, despite the lack of sunlight and rain. Their efforts turned the indoor space into a ""plant hospital"" where moribund blooms are revived
Sue Buck clinched the 'Art in Bloom Award' for her multimedia canvas depicting flowers of the future. She painted the future Piccadilly line train stock alongside depictions of flowers enhanced with found objects like rings and brooches
Neasden Depot bagged the 'Best Seasoned Entry' with their newly installed irrigation system and well-laid gardens of gladioli 
Ruislip Depot won the 'Environment Award'. The reuse and transformation of salvaged items such as lawn chairs into planters brought vibrance to the depot and created a welcoming workspace for colleagues
Willesden Junction Underground station secured the 'Sandra Wilkes Community Award'. Their collaboration with community volunteers transformed transitional spaces between the trains and buses into a colourful garden filled with fruit trees, pollinating plants and wildflowers 
Almost a third of TfL's circa 6,000-acre estate is covered by green vegetation, with a wide variety of habitats, from woodlands to wetlands, that support more than 1,000 animal species and almost 700 plant species.

Motivated to protect and enhance the environment, TfL has various strategies to renew its assets with energy-efficient technologies and materials across the network - including the use of LED lighting and low-carbon materials. By 2030, TfL aims to source 100 per cent of its electricity from renewable energy.

With new benchmarks to track progress in habitat protection and connectivity, TfL has taken concrete steps to increase biodiversity across its properties. With a comprehensive biodiversity strategy and using available areas - such as wildflower habitats in roadside verges and street tree plantation drives - TfL continues to reinforce its commitment to a healthier and greener future for London. ",0.25260228758121445,Wed,0.96,1.21,1.07,1.01,NA,NA,0.94,0.96,0.86,1.0084033613445378,1.0151006711409396,1.0164661177960737,1.0073138297872342,NA,NA,1.0585585585585584,0.9789259007477905,0.9809885931558935,1.0154373927958833,1.035803111805194,1.0333442088091354,1.0161794697484705,NA,NA,1.0907095256762054,1.0047364400305576,1.0041762550072444

 TfL's General Manager for the DLR
 


 
Customers are at the heart of the new contract with a number of key improvements planned, including the appearance and availability of ticket machines, lifts and escalators 
Transport for London (TfL) has awarded KeolisAmey a new eight-year contract to operate and maintain the DLR, a franchise they have successfully run for the past 10 years.

The new franchise, which is due to start on 1 April 2025, was awarded to KeolisAmey following a competitive tendering process with the new contract focused on delivering a number of key improvements to help deliver a better customer experience and meet future projected demand for services.

The key improvements include: 

Making enhancements to timetables to deliver higher frequencies of service and capacity upgrades to support population growth across the network, particularly in parts of Royal Dock and the Isle of Dogs where the DLR is the main transport option 
Supporting TfL in improving London's air quality by reducing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions 
Supporting TfL's Vision Zero commitments to eliminate deaths and serious injuries across London's transport network 
Helping to improve the customer experience by: 
Fully rolling out and promoting Access DLR, a free travel assistance service for anyone over 18 who needs extra support
New customer satisfaction targets around the appearance and availability of ticket machines, lifts, escalators and information systems to create a better experience
Improved ways to measure performance to ensure customers receive the best possible service 

New performance incentives to give an increased focus on reducing levels of fare evasion and protecting TfL's revenue 
Supporting the introduction of 54 new DLR trains on to the network to help improve the frequency and reliability of services.  The new trains will replace the 33 oldest trains in the fleet, with a further 21 helping boost overall capacity by 50 per cent   
Tom Page, TfL's General Manager for the DLR, said: 

'I am looking forward to continuing to work with KeolisAmey. Over the next few years, customers will benefit from a number of improvements, including a fleet of new trains offering increased capacity and frequency, so the continuing support and new ideas KeolisAmey will bring to enhance the experience for customers will be invaluable.'

Alistair Gordon, chief executive of Keolis UK, said: 

'We're delighted to continue our journey with TfL and are looking forward to working together over the coming years to benefit all DLR customers. KeolisAmey is excited to deliver further improvements to the customer experience, support the introduction of the new trains and enhance capacity on this integral part of London's transport network.'

With more than 90 million journeys made each year, the DLR is the busiest light railway in the UK. It serves a growing employment centre and cultural hub at Stratford, allowing people from across southeast London to reach new jobs in east London without the need to travel through Zone 1. It also serves Canary Wharf, a vitally important centre for the financial and professional service industries, where it links with the Tube network and the Elizabeth line. 

The DLR operates across six Opportunity Areas in London, which have the potential to provide more than 124,000 homes and 200,000 jobs. There are around 45,000 of these homes either already under construction or with planning permission within walking distance of the DLR.  The new train programme will deliver additional capacity that is essential to support further sustainable growth beyond that already permitted, particularly in parts of the Royal Docks and the Isle of Dogs where the DLR is such a vital transport option. ",0.31788728921695464,Thu,0.96,1.17,1.05,1.01,NA,NA,0.97,0.96,0.86,1.0084033613445378,0.9815436241610738,0.9974667511082964,1.0073138297872342,NA,NA,1.0923423423423424,0.9789259007477905,0.9809885931558935,1.0154373927958833,1.0015616866215513,1.0140293637846656,1.0161794697484705,NA,NA,1.1255194041552332,1.0047364400305576,1.0041762550072444
2024-10-04,Oct, London’s Cycleway network expands to cover more than 400km,"Following the recent launch of a number of new Cycleways, London's Cycleway network expands to more than 400km in length
 
 




 ""London's rapidly expanding cycle network is helping people get from A to B safely and sustainably, and is enabling hundreds more Londoners to try cycling""
 
  Sadiq Khan
 The Mayor of London
 


 
The network has more than quadrupled in size since 2016, meaning that 27 per cent of Londoners now live within 400m of a high-quality cycle route
Ensuring that everyone can travel safely and sustainably is vital to improving people's health and improving air quality
London's Cycleways network reached a key milestone this week, as the expansion of eight Cycleways across the capital means the total network is now more than 400km. As part of the Mayor of London and Transport for London's (TfL's) commitment to making cycling around the capital safer and easier, the network has more than quadrupled in size from just 90km in 2016. This expanding cycling network plays a vital role in ensuring that Londoners can travel safely and sustainably, and helps to tackle air pollution, congestion and the climate crisis, improving the health and wellbeing of people in neighbourhoods across the capital.

Last week, TfL published new data which shows that road fatalities have reduced by 30 per cent in London compared to seven per cent for the rest of Great Britain*. Improvements in infrastructure, including new Cycleways, are key to further reducing danger on the capital's roads.

The newly created or upgraded Cycleways include new sections of protected Cycleway on busier roads, as well as sections delivered on quieter residential streets, with clear signage to make navigation easier. The success of London boroughs in reducing traffic and speed limits on residential streets continues to enable this vital expansion of London's Cycleway network.

The recently launched Cycleways that further expand the network in London include: 

Cycleway 9 - Kew Bridge to Brentford

A 1km extension of fully protected route in Hounslow from Kew Bridge to Brentford, connecting C9 to C40  

Cycleway 6 - Chalk Farm to Hampstead

A fully protected 1.25km extension of C6 in Camden along main roads linking to Camden Town's markets 

Cycleway - Chalk Farm to Swiss Cottage

A 1km route in Camden linking to C6 along quieter residential streets, connecting Primrose Hill and passing next to The Roundhouse venue 

Cycleway - Kentish Town to Hampstead Heath via Gospel Oak   

A 1.8km Cycleway which now enables people cycling to travel direct from Kentish Town to Hampstead Heath along quieter residential streets, linking to Queen's Crescent Market, Gospel Oak station and Parliament Fields 

Cycleway 27 - Marylebone to Clerkenwell 

Significant upgrades to the existing protected cycle lanes in Camden along Tavistock Place and Torrington Place to double the capacity, making cycling safer and alleviating congestion. The route links to Tottenham Court Road, The British Museum and University College London campus 

Cycleway - Colliers Wood to Wimbledon 

A 3.67km Cycleway in Merton along quieter residential streets linking these two important town centres along with their transport hubs 

Cycleway 25 - Leytonstone to Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park  

A new 2.83km Cycleway in Waltham Forest with protected cycle tracks on Grove Green Road, connecting with C26 at Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park  

Cycleway - Ilford to Gants Hill  

A new 1.68km Cycleway in Redbridge connecting to C42 - this route follows quieter streets, where 20mph speed restrictions and traffic calming measures have been implemented as part of the scheme. The route has also created a section of protected cycle track close to Ilford Station and the Exchange shopping centre  

The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said: 

'London's rapidly expanding cycle network is helping people get from A to B safely and sustainably, and is enabling hundreds more Londoners to try cycling. I'm delighted that these recent improvements mean Londoners living and working across our city - from Hounslow to Camden, Redbridge to Waltham Forest - will now benefit from new Cycleways.'

Helen Cansick, TfL's Head of Healthy Streets Investment, said:

'We are excited to see a network of Cycleways continuing to emerge across London, helping unlock safer and more accessible cycling to even more Londoners. These high-quality cycling networks bring a range of benefits to local communities, and we are continuing to work closely with boroughs and invest in further active travel schemes. We look forward to continuing our work to enable Londoners easy access to our cycle network.'

Sarah Javaid MBE, CEO of Cycle Sisters said: 

'We really welcome the expansion of London's Cycleways to help make cycling safer.   We often hear from our network of women that safety fears are one of the key barriers to cycling so high quality and connected cycle networks are vitally important to make cycling more accessible.   Alongside this, we're keen to keep working with Transport for London and other partners to ensure that the benefits of cycling reach all communities through investment in initiatives such as cycle training and social led rides.'

Oli Ivens, London Director for Sustrans, said:

'We warmly welcome this expansion of Cycleways across London. The increased reach of the network means that Transport for London is prioritising designing our city in a way that enables everyone to move around more freely and Londoners are given the space and confidence to break free of car dependency. We trust that this will inspire people to shift everyday travel to walking, wheeling and cycling, and in the process forge closer connections with our neighbours and reduce traffic to create a better environment and more sustainable society for everyone.'

The expansion of the network follows on from the launch of TfL Cycle Sundays, which offers a range of easy-to-follow leisure cycle routes and maps across London to explore the capital on Sundays. The Cycle Sundays campaign was developed in collaboration with leading cycling organisations and aims to offer beginner friendly journeys for Londoners, backed up by a range of support to make it even easier to try out cycling for the first time, or after a break.

TfL's updated Cycling Action Plan 2, published last year, highlights the fundamental role cycling plays in making a greener, more progressive, modern city. The plan outlines why it is essential to broaden the appeal of cycling to a more diverse range of Londoners to ensure cycling levels continue to increase at pace and that all Londoners benefit from the health and economic benefits of cycling. TfL's research shows that people from under-represented groups are open to taking up cycling, but experience different barriers, and the plan outlines ambitious evidence-led measures to support these groups by addressing these barriers.",0.3317131623547999,Fri,0.97,1.16,1.04,1.01,NA,NA,0.94,0.96,0.86,1.01890756302521,0.9731543624161073,0.9879670677644079,1.0073138297872342,NA,NA,1.0585585585585584,0.9789259007477905,0.9809885931558935,1.0260148656375072,0.9930013303256405,1.0043719412724306,1.0161794697484705,NA,NA,1.0907095256762054,1.0047364400305576,1.0041762550072444

Crisis works with Mildmay Hospital and on 10 October, TfL and Arriva Rail London will donate the cost of hot drinks bought, up to £1,000 per station
Crisis volunteers will also fundraise at stations along the future London Overground Mildmay line
Transport for London (TfL) and Arriva Rail London have partnered with the national homelessness charity Crisis to fundraise on World Homeless Day at five stations along what will become the London Overground Mildmay line later this year.

On Thursday 10 October, any customers who buy hot drinks at cafes at Camden Road, Gospel Oak, Hackney Central, Highbury & Islington, and Shepherd's Bush London Overground stations will support people experiencing homelessness. TfL and Arriva Rail London will donate the cost of those hot drinks to Crisis up to £1,000 per station*, and Crisis volunteers will also fundraise at stations along the London Overground Mildmay line. Alongside this, TfL will host various charities across the transport network to further raise awareness of homelessness and how to support those who are homeless.

Arriva Rail London is also partnering with City Harvest this October to help deliver 50,000 meals to those in need across the capital. London Overground staff will host food collection points at 17 London Overground stations and will work with City Harvest to divert quality food from local businesses that would otherwise go to waste and redistribute it to those facing food poverty across London.**

Later this year, London Overground lines will be given new names and colours in a historic change to capital's transport network. The London Overground line, which runs between Richmond and Clapham Junction to Stratford, will be named the Mildmay line to honour the small NHS charitable hospital that has been caring for all Londoners over many years, notably its pivotal role in the HIV/AIDS crisis in the 1980s and its ongoing work to support people experiencing homelessness today.

Crisis partners with Pathway, the leading homeless healthcare charity, which works with Mildmay Hospital. The hospital became the first specialist unit aiming to provide a pioneering step-down medical service to support people experiencing homeless in London and surrounding areas in 2020.*** Mildmay Hospital now runs a ground-breaking service employing the expertise of doctors, nurses and therapists to ease the burden on NHS hospitals by providing rehabilitative healthcare for people are facing homelessness or rough sleeping and recovering from illness or injury. Once discharged from Mildmay, the aim is that people will be supported by specialist homelessness charities.

Trish Ashton, Director of Rail Services at TfL, said: ""Homelessness affects too many people in the capital and we are committed to doing all we can to support them. Mildmay was chosen as one of the new names for the six London Overground lines in part because of their pioneering work to support people experiencing homelessness.

""We hope that our activities along what will become the London Overground Mildmay line later this year on World Homeless Day will not only help to raise thousands of pounds to support the vital work Crisis does to support people experiencing homelessness across London and the UK but will encourage our customers to think about how they can also support homeless charities.""

Executive Director of Brand, Marketing and Fundraising, Rob Halkyard, at Crisis, said: ""We are so grateful to be fundraising on what will become the London Overground Mildmay line this year for World Homelessness Day.

""We know that being without a home puts people at greater risk of physical and mental health conditions and in the worst cases, sadly shortens people's lives. Mildmay Hospital does incredible work with people facing homelessness to help rebuild their health so they can move on from homelessness. That's why it's very special to be fundraising on a line named after a hospital that tackles the health inequalities of some of the most marginalised people in society.

""The generous donations we receive from people travelling along the line will help us to continue our vital work to support people to leave homelessness behind and ensure that one day we see it ended for good."" 

Geoff Coleman, Chief Executive of Mildmay Hospital, said: ""Along with other homelessness charities across London, we stand shoulder to shoulder with the Mayor of London and his team in our efforts to end homelessness in the capital by 2030 and really support this fundraising activity along the future London Overground Mildmay line.""

The Mayor of London has pledged to end rough sleeping in the capital by 2030. The Mayor has committed £10 million to fund an expanded network of homeless hubs across the capital. The hubs are designed to help an extra 1,700 rough sleepers every year with rapid assessment and rehousing.****

Tom Copley, the Deputy Mayor of London for Housing and Residential Development, said: ""It's fantastic to see TfL and Arriva Rail London backing the important work that Crisis do and joining the Mayor in his mission to tackle homelessness and make London a fairer, safer place for everyone. 

""I'm grateful to all Londoners who will give what they can to support this important cause by buying a hot drink or donating when using the future London Overground Mildmay line. Every single contribution will help make a difference and be a fitting way to honour the legacy of the Mildmay Hospital which continues to provide care and support for people facing homelessness and rough sleeping across the capital.""

Helping rough sleepers to get the support they need is also a key priority for TfL. People sleeping rough are highly vulnerable and require support from specialist outreach and other services. TfL's safeguarding team assess reports of rough sleeping from front line staff and works with the relevant support services to assist the vulnerable individuals.

2024-10-14,Oct, TfL invites Londoners to participate in active bystander training,"Hundreds of places on active bystander training sessions available thanks to TfL funding during National Hate Crime Awareness Week
 
 




 ""Ensuring Londoners' safety is the Mayor's number one priority, and tackling hate crime is a key component of our work to ensure that people can travel around our city with confidence""
 
 Seb Dance
 Deputy Mayor for Transport
 


 
Training builds on TfL's hate crime campaign that launched in 2021 and active bystander campaign that launched last year
Initially, 28 per cent of participants knew what to do if a hate incident occurred to someone else, rising to 87 per cent after the training 
This year, to mark National Hate Crime Awareness Week, Transport for London is funding hundreds of free Active Bystander Awareness sessions* over the autumn and winter, as part of its efforts to empower Londoners to safely take action when they encounter hate crime on the transport network.

Throughout National Hate Crime Awareness Week (12-19 October), TfL is working with the police to run a series of events across the transport network to raise awareness of hate crime and the work TfL is doing to tackle it, to help reassure those who may lack confidence to travel on public transport and empower Londoners to support their fellow passengers.

Many Londoners remain worried about hate crime, including people from Jewish and Muslim communities who have seen a significant rise in incidents in the past year. TfL is committed to tackling hate, intolerance and extremism and continues to take a zero-tolerance approach to all forms of abuse on its network. Thousands of frontline staff are trained to support customers, with more than 500 TfL enforcement officers and around 2,000 police and police community support officers patrolling the network.

To help support Londoners to speak up and support one another to prevent abuse or harassment, TfL is hosting free online Active Bystander Awareness training this autumn and winter. The interactive three-hour course is led by the identity-based violence prevention charity Protection Approaches, and was developed in partnership with the Britain's East and Southeast Asian Network. 

These sessions aim to empower people to take action to prevent or reduce harm when they encounter hate crime by looking at how to respond to a series of hypothetical scenarios. With the course partly funded by the Mayor's Shared Endeavour Fund, TfL has added to this funding to expand the training to even more Londoners. The sessions will be held from late October to early December, are aimed at all Londoners and require no previous knowledge.

More than 200 Londoners benefitted from the free training last year with participants consistently providing positive feedback and reporting increased confidence in dealing with hate crime incidents. At the start of the sessions, 28 per cent participants knew what to do if a hate incident occurred to someone else, rising to 87 per cent after the training. 

Deputy Mayor for Transport, Seb Dance, said: ""Ensuring Londoners' safety is the Mayor's number one priority, and tackling hate crime is a key component of our work to ensure that people can travel around our city with confidence. It's brilliant to see these important training sessions being offered to even more Londoners, as part of our efforts to build a safer, fairer and greener London.""

Siwan Hayward, TfL's Director of Security, Policing and Enforcement, said: ""Over the last year we've seen an abhorrent increase in hate crimes directed at Jewish and Muslim communities which must be stopped. We are determined to eradicate hate crime in all its forms from London's transport network. 

""During National Hate Crime Awareness Week, we are encouraging Londoners to become active bystanders by funding hundreds of places on Active Bystander training sessions with Protection Approaches. These sessions have already empowered hundreds of Londoners to speak up and support one another to prevent abuse or harassment. I would really encourage Londoners who are keen to find out how they can support victims of hate crime to sign up.""

Andy Fearn, Co-Executive Director of Protection Approaches, said: ""Events over the past year have led to more and more Londoners to ask what they can do to help if they encounter hate. Whether it's an inappropriate comment in the workplace, harassment on the Tube, or a physical assault in the street, our Active Bystander training is proven to help people feel more confident and equipped to act safely and in ways that ensure the best outcomes for victims. We're delighted to be partnering with TfL and to be providing this training for its passengers. Together, this work will make London that little bit safer.""

Tom Naughton, Chief Superintendent of Metropolitan Police Service said: ""London's transport network is a space for everyone, and it is our collective responsibility to ensure that it remains safe, inclusive, and welcoming for all people, regardless of their race, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, or any other characteristic. Hate crimes not only harm individuals but also undermine the strength and unity of our diverse city.

""The Metropolitan Police Service, in collaboration with TfL, is dedicated to preventing hate crimes and supporting victims. We work tirelessly to ensure that incidents are reported, investigated, and addressed with the seriousness they deserve. We encourage all Londoners to report hate crimes, whether they are victims or witnesses. By working together with our partners, local communities, and support networks, we can build a city where everyone feels safe and valued.""

Chris Casey, Chief Superintendent of British Transport Police said: ""We stand strong in our fight against hate crime and we will listen to, and act swiftly in response to, concerns raised by those travelling on the network.

""Abuse, intimidation or violence will never be tolerated and initiatives like the Active Bystander Awareness sessions will further our work to banish these behaviours and allow individuals to feel empowered in supporting their fellow passengers.

""We will continue to work with our policing, rail and community partners to ensure we are doing everything in our power to protect you and make you feel safe."" 

Michael Roberts, CEO of London Travelwatch, said: ""Our ongoing research into personal security on London Transport, and our report Out in London, highlighted the worrying scale of hate crime and harassment on London transport, but also showed the high percentage of people that felt it wouldn't be safe to intervene if they witnessed such a crime. 

""The excellent Active Bystander Awareness training sessions will help educate and empower Londoners to take action if they witness any form of hate crime, and will contribute towards a safer transport system for everyone."" 

A hate crime is any crime perceived by the victim or any other person to be motivated by hostility on the grounds of race, religion, sexual orientation, disability or transgender identity. One of the themes for this year's National Hate Crime Awareness Week is tackling hate crime that LGBTQ+ people experience. A report from London TravelWatch last year, Out in London, showed that 21 per cent of survey respondents experienced hate crime within the last year while travelling on London's transport network and 65 per cent of respondents who had experienced abuse or harm said bystanders had witnessed the event but did not intervene, with many respondents expressing they would not feel safe themselves to do so. 

TfL launched Equity in Motion last year, a plan with more than 80 actions to make London transport fairer, more accessible and more inclusive. By 2026, focussed research and engagement will look to better understand the experiences of disabled customers, women and girls, and LGBTQ+ people and their concerns about safety and security, and in the following year, frontline staff will be provided with training, guidance and tools to support victims of sexual violence and harassment, and hate crime.

2024-10-16,Oct, TfL steps up enforcement against persistent ULEZ penalty charge evaders,"£25.6million debt recouped by enforcement agents over 12 months following non-payment of penalties
 
 




 ""The most recent data shows that on average, over 96 per cent of vehicles seen driving in the ULEZ are compliant""
 
 Alex Williams
 TfL's Chief Customer and Strategy Officer
 


 
More than 1,400 vehicles seized over the course of a year and over £700,000 recouped by sale of vehicles belonging to persistent non-payers 
Vast majority of vehicles driving in the zone are now compliant, and drivers encouraged to sign up to Auto Pay to avoid being fined
Support available for those in difficult circumstances struggling to pay PCNs 
Additional steps to recover debt, including seeking County Court Judgements considered against those that refuse to pay
TfL is tripling the number of people in its investigations team to boost the work with enforcement agents
Transport for London (TfL) is cracking down on drivers who persistently evade penalty charge notices (PCNs) issued for Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ) contraventions.

A cohort of people who refuse to pay multiple PCNs means that a significant amount of debt remains outstanding, which could be reinvested into improving the transport network for the benefit of all Londoners.

TfL is tripling the number of people in its investigations team to boost the work with enforcement agents to target those in polluting vehicles that refuse to pay the daily charges. Boosting its intelligence-led approach will be used in tandem with other enforcement action including the ability of bailiffs to visit an evader's address, clamp a vehicle, remove a vehicle and sell it at auction. This is in addition to the further fees that evaders accrue when they do not to pay the fine within the statutory time limit.

On 29 August 2023, the Ultra Low Emission Zone expanded London-wide to help tackle the triple challenges of air pollution, the climate emergency and traffic congestion. In London, around 4,000 premature deaths are attributed to toxic air each year, as well as increased risks of asthma, cancer and dementia. Air pollution also disproportionately affects poorer Londoners, and those from Black, Asian and minority ethnic communities. Any income generated from the scheme is being reinvested back into public transport, including improving bus routes in outer London. The scheme is not designed to generate revenue, as TfL wants all cars to be compliant.

The latest data shows that over 96 per cent of vehicles seen driving in the zone comply with the emissions standards, meaning the vast majority of drivers do not need to pay the daily charge. TfL's cameras check the number plates of vehicles driving in the zone, and if no charge is paid for a non-compliant vehicle within three days of the journey taking place, and no Auto Pay arrangement is in place, a penalty charge notice (PCN) is sent to the registered keeper. If a vehicle's registered keeper does not pay the penalty, it is registered as an unpaid debt and an order made for its recovery. If still not paid this leads to a Court-issued warrant, and enforcement action to recover the outstanding debt.

If a registered keeper ignores a warrant, bailiffs visit their address to recover money owed. In July, a driver with 45 warrants against them was traced by TfL agents to a new address. They claimed that they no longer owned the vehicle, but TfL's investigations team established that the PCNs were received before the vehicle was sold. The driver settled their balance of almost £16,000. Another repeat offender with 21 warrants against their vehicle was visited multiple times by TfL enforcement agents and made a series of payments to settle their outstanding debt of over £7,800.

Enforcement agents also have the power to seize particular belongings of the debtor, and use the proceeds to satisfy any outstanding debt. In August, a car was located, seized and removed after ignoring ten warrants. The driver in question had been issued with a total of 43 letters and been visited by bailiffs five times previously. Between August 2023 and July 2024, 1,429 cars were seized and removed by bailiffs. Between August 2023 and July 2024, 761 seized cars were auctioned, recovering £710,147 of debts accrued by the minority who refuse to pay the ULEZ charge.

TfL encourages anyone who has received a ULEZ penalty charge to engage with the notice. Staff work proactively with the registered keeper to reach a solution, including setting up payment plans where appropriate, to make fines owed more manageable, and signposting to charities and resources so that they can directly seek any assistance they need.

Alex Williams, TfL's Chief Customer and Strategy Officer, said: ""The most recent data shows that on average, over 96 per cent of vehicles seen driving in the ULEZ are compliant.

""We want to send a clear message to vehicle owners that if you receive a penalty charge for driving in the zone, you should not ignore it. Your penalty will progress to enforcement agents to recover the fines that you owe, and there is a risk that your vehicle and other items of property will be removed.

""The aim of the ULEZ is to clean up London's air and remove old polluting cars from the road so no drivers need to pay and no fines occur. There is only a small minority of drivers who are eligible for the charge, and even fewer who are refusing to pay - but we encourage anyone experiencing financial difficulties not to ignore PCNs, and to engage with our staff, who will work with you towards a resolution, including setting up debt payment plans.""

TfL encourages drivers to sign up to its Auto Pay system, which enables customers to be billed automatically when their vehicle enters the ULEZ and therefore avoids a fine. Customers registered with Auto Pay are debited on a monthly basis for daily charges and receive a monthly statement of the charges. Those registered with Auto Pay holders have 90 days to dispute any charges debited.

All penalty charge notices - a statutory notice - are sent with a guidance leaflet written in clear, uncomplicated language, offering advice on what the PCN means, how to challenge one and how to avoid receiving one in future. TfL's website also provides further detail on how to make a representation, how to appeal the outcome of a representation, and a document outlining the rights of the recipient in relation to enforcement agents.

A pilot scheme to offer increased support to vulnerable recipients of penalty charges is set to be introduced in the coming months. The scheme will include new guidance for TfL staff to assist those experiencing hardship, such as referring to a partner organisation which provides financial guidance.

The introduction of the London-wide ULEZ in August 2023 was supported by a £210million scrappage scheme, open to all Londoners, small businesses, and charities with non-compliant vehicles. The scheme has seen funding committed to around 54,700 applicants to help them transition to cleaner, greener modes of transport and avoid paying the daily charge.",0.20127790709764198,Wed,0.93,1.2,1.06,0.99,NA,NA,0.88,1,0.89,0.9768907563025211,1.0067114093959733,1.006966434452185,0.9873670212765958,NA,NA,0.990990990990991,1.0197144799456153,1.015209125475285,0.9837049742710121,1.0272427555092833,1.0236867862969006,0.996057104010877,NA,NA,1.0210897687181497,1.0466004583651642,1.0392056592516832

 Sadiq Khan
 The Mayor of London
 


 
The new state-of-the-art Piccadilly line trains will start entering service by the end of 2025 with the full fleet of 94 trains expected to be rolled out by the end of 2027
The train was pulled by rail locomotives from its test track in Wildenrath, Germany to London, via the Channel Tunnel, covering a distance of around 400 miles
The new trains feature walk-through carriages, wider doorways, digital customer information screens, CCTV cameras and, for the first time on a Deep Tube train, air-conditioning
Trains will be more energy efficient, consuming 20 per cent less energy than the existing fleet
Transport for London (TfL) has welcomed the first of the new Piccadilly line trains to the capital, ahead of a programme of intensive testing before the new trains start entering service by the end of 2025.

The test train is the first of a fleet of 94 new trains that are being built for TfL by Siemens Mobility to replace the existing fleet which is nearly 50 years old. They are part of a £2.9bn modernisation programme which will boost journey times, train frequency and reliability as well as making the Piccadilly line more accessible and sustainable.

Around 80 per cent of the new trains will be built at Siemens Mobility's new factory in Goole, East Yorkshire, which was officially opened earlier this month. The test train was built in Siemens Mobility's factory in Vienna, Austria and has spent the last year on the test track in Wildenrath in Germany. From there, it made its 400-mile journey to London where it will undergo a period of commissioning activities before rigorous integration testing begins to ensure it is compatible with existing infrastructure on the Piccadilly line. Testing will initially take place overnight during engineering hours and some planned closures, with test trains running during the day in gaps between normal services as the date of their introduction gets closer.

The new Piccadilly line trains are set to transform the journeys of millions of customers on one of the Underground's busiest lines. The nine-carriage trains will increase capacity by around 10 per cent and feature walk-through, air-conditioned carriages, wider all-double doorways to help customers get on and off more easily, enhanced digital display screens for real-time customer information, and on-train CCTV cameras for additional customer security. The trains are lighter than existing designs which means they are more energy efficient and provide a smoother ride for customers, consuming 20 per cent less energy.

All of the new Piccadilly line trains are expected to be in service by the end of 2027 when the frequency of trains will increase from the current 24 trains per hour to 27 trains per hour.

The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said: ""It's an exciting moment for London as testing begins on the new Piccadilly line trains. These state-of-the-art trains - most of which will be manufactured here in the UK - will be more spacious, equipped with CCTV cameras and, for the first time ever in a Deep Tube train, air-conditioned, to make everyone's journeys more comfortable.

""These new trains are just one example of the work we're doing to continue delivering the world-class transport network Londoners deserve, building a better, greener London for everyone.""

Stuart Harvey, TfL's Chief Capital Officer, said: ""The countdown is on for the next generation of Tube trains to start serving London, with the arrival of the first, new Piccadilly line train in the capital this month. These new trains are going to transform the experience of millions of our customers, providing a more frequent and reliable service on walk-through, air-conditioned trains with a host of features that will make journeys quicker, easier and more comfortable. We now have a year of rigorously testing the new trains before we start bringing them into service by the end of 2025.""

Sambit Banerjee, Joint CEO at Siemens Mobility, said: ""I'm delighted that the first new Piccadilly line train has arrived in London for testing, an exciting milestone made possible by the great partnership between Siemens Mobility and TfL. With 80 per cent of the new Piccadilly line trains being assembled in our new state-of-the-art Rail Village in Goole, Siemens Mobility and TfL are working together to back British jobs and transform rail travel in the capital.""

The scale of the Piccadilly Line Upgrade, which is taking place on one of London's deepest Tube lines with some of the oldest track and signalling infrastructure, means that a series of closures are ongoing to complete vital track and platform upgrades. TfL is also using any part closures as an opportunity to complete additional depot, signalling, power supply and track maintenance work to help keep the line in the best condition possible to provide a safe and reliable service for customers.

TfL is also progressing work on plans to upgrade and extend the Bakerloo line, with the immediate priority securing the long-term capital funding certainty that would allow the replacement of the existing 36-train Bakerloo line fleet. At over 50 years old, it is the oldest operating in daily passenger service anywhere in the UK. Securing a new fleet of trains, which the Siemens Mobility factory in Goole would be expected to deliver, and signalling would transform the Bakerloo line, boosting accessibility, reliability and comfort for the millions of customers who use it each year.",0.2688963937635967,Wed,0.93,1.2,1.06,0.99,NA,NA,0.88,1,0.89,0.9768907563025211,1.0067114093959733,1.006966434452185,0.9873670212765958,NA,NA,0.990990990990991,1.0197144799456153,1.015209125475285,0.9837049742710121,1.0272427555092833,1.0236867862969006,0.996057104010877,NA,NA,1.0210897687181497,1.0466004583651642,1.0392056592516832

Transport for London (TfL) is moving forward with its next phase of plans to reduce road danger for people walking and cycling on and near Battersea Bridge. Construction work will begin on 1 November and include an 11-month programme of improvements to pavements and traffic signals, as well as changes to the road layout at several junctions along Battersea Bridge Road on the south side of the river, and at the Cheyne Walk junction on the north side.

TfL will begin work on the south side of the river at the junction of Battersea Bridge Road and Cambridge Road, moving north towards the bridge one junction at a time to minimise potential disruption. These works are part of TfL's Safer Junction programme to improve safety in areas across London with higher-than-average collision rates and to protect bus journey times along the Battersea Bridge corridor. Making roads and junctions safer for everyone is a key part of the Mayor's Vision Zero goal of eliminating death and serious injury on the transport network by 2041.

Following public consultation in late 2022 and early 2023, TfL is proceeding with the following changes to the Battersea Bridge area:

Installation of three new controlled crossing points, improving cycle facilities, creating two new sections of bus lanes, and building out two corners at the Cheyne Walk junction to increase pavement space to encourage lower speeds.
Installation of new signalised pedestrian crossings at the junction of Battersea Bridge Road and Prince of Wales Drive, and at the southern end of Battersea Bridge.
Introduction of new signalised crossing points to improve safety, modernising existing traffic signals, and upgrading pavements at Battersea Bridge Road's junctions with Battersea Church Road and Westbridge/Parkgate Road.
Installation of a signalised bus gate across the southern approach onto Battersea Bridge.
Permanently relocating 'Battersea Bridge' (BL) bus stop and shelter a short distance (around 15 metres) from its current location.
Installation of a new cycle lane, upgrading the pedestrian crossing, and installing a new section of bus lane at the junction of Battersea Road and Cambridge Road.
Amending traffic lane widths over Battersea Bridge to make it safer for cyclists using the bridge.
Improved road markings throughout the Battersea Bridge area to improve driver behaviour and pedestrian and cyclist safety.
Improving existing drainage systems and installing cycle-friendly gullies.
Construction work will begin on 1 November and is planned to finish in autumn next year. TfL will work to keep disruption to the road network to a minimum. While work is being carried out, there may be some delays on roads and on several bus routes. TfL is advising people to plan ahead and use alternative routes where possible. The latest status updates can be found on the TfL website for both buses and roads.

TfL brought forward plans to improve safety on the bridge following a passionate campaign, led by local journalist Rob McGibbon and other groups, after the tragic death of Jack Ryan on Battersea Bridge on 13 January 2021. The first phase of work on the north side of the bridge was completed in November 2021 and included a new pedestrian crossing, wider pavements and a new lower speed limit of 20mph. These works complete the safety upgrade to the Cheyne Walk junction and delivery of additional improvements on the south side of Battersea Bridge.

Penny Rees, TfL's Head of Healthy Streets Investment, said: ""We are committed to Vision Zero, the Mayor's goal to eliminate death and serious injury from the transport network, and these changes will play a vital role in reducing danger at this key junction.

""I would like to thank local safety campaigners, including journalist Rob McGibbon, and the local community for working with us to develop these proposals. We have seen large reductions in collisions at other junctions where we have introduced similar improvements, and hope these works will make a real difference to the safety of people walking and cycling in the local area.""

Will Norman, The Walking and Cycling Commissioner, said: ""Making London's roads safer is the Mayor's and my highest priority and it is vital in enabling more people to choose walking and cycling. I'm delighted that the work to improve safety around Battersea bridge will be starting in November. These important upgrades will make the roads and junctions safer for all road users, building a better, safer and greener London for everyone.""

Wandsworth Councillor Jenny Yates, Cabinet Member for Transport said: ""Wandsworth Council fully supports the work TfL is doing to make the Battersea Bridge area safer for pedestrians and cyclists. Improving road safety is a key priority for us as we continue to encourage more residents to walk and cycle as part of our commitment to active travel.""

TfL continues to work in partnership with the boroughs, police and other stakeholders to directly tackle road danger and continues to work on a number of major programmes to make London's roads and the vehicles using them safer. TfL's world-first Direct Vision Standard, which reduces lethal blind spots on lorries, is already helping to save lives and prevent life-changing injuries. From next week, TfL will be enhancing DVS requirements with all HGVs over 12 tonnes required to have a three-star rating or fit Progressive Safe System measures to operate in Greater London. TfL has also continued to work on its Safer Junctions programme to make life-saving changes at some of the capital's most dangerous and intimidating junctions. TfL has so far completed work at 45 junctions across London as part of the programme, with works at Lambeth Bridge also underway.",0.2698208643236754,Wed,0.94,1.2,1.07,1,NA,NA,0.9,0.97,0.87,0.9873949579831932,1.0067114093959733,1.0164661177960737,0.9973404255319149,NA,NA,1.0135135135135136,0.9891230455472467,0.9923954372623573,0.9942824471126357,1.0272427555092833,1.0333442088091354,1.0061182868796736,NA,NA,1.044296354370835,1.0152024446142094,1.015852723088724

A new mural by renowned British artist and Turner Prize 2024 nominee Claudette Johnson has launched today (Friday 25 October) at Brixton Underground station as part of Transport for London's (TfL) Art on the Underground programme.

Johnson's first public artwork, Three Women, follows a changing series of murals installed at Brixton Underground station by artists including Denzil Forrester, Joy Labinjo and Njideka Akunyili Crosby, in recognition of the local murals painted in the area in the 1980s.

Three Women is a three-part artwork known as a triptych that features Black female figures referenced in one of her previous works, Trilogy 1982-86, which she created in the 1980s. The sitting positions of the Black female figures share a resonance with Picasso's Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (1907). This painting by Picasso, whose problematic and fractured engagement with African art and the female form marked shifts in Johnson's early work, evoked questions about how she might locate herself in her work, and as a Black woman confront the denials and distortions of Western art history. With Three Women, Johnson returns to these questions with three subjects instilled with a self-possessed subjectivity that runs counter to the eroticised forms and colonial gaze of modernist art movements. 

Johnson works primarily in large-scale drawings, using a range of media, from gouache and watercolour to oil, pastel and pencil. Often captured from life, Johnson's figures are monolithic in scale, reaching to the edges of the frame and yet intimately encountered. Addressing the personal as political and challenging harmful stereotypes of representation through human figures and gesture, Johnson's work gives space and power to the presence of Black people and offers a mediation on shared humanity.

Depicted in monumental form for Brixton Underground station, these figures reach beyond the composition, as though resisting the confines of the conventional frame and interrupting a homogenised understanding of African art and of the Black female figure.

Claudette Johnson, said: ""Three Women was inspired by an earlier work, Trilogy 1982-86, which depicts three standing figures adopting poses that reflect their way of being in the world. In Three Women, I have loosely referenced Picasso's 1907 painting, Les Demoiselles D'Avignon by having the sitters adopt seated poses that reflect those of some of 'les demoiselles'. I am fascinated by the power that emanates from these postures and this is borne from my longstanding interest in women, power and how we claim space in places where we have been absent, obscured, caricatured or denied.""

Justine Simons OBE, Deputy Mayor for Culture and the Creative Industries, said: ""Art on the Underground is part of the fabric of London's transport network and an amazing way to showcase incredible artistic talent to millions of people every day. I'm delighted that the renowned Claudette Johnson is the next artist to display her work at Brixton Underground station - putting a triptych of Black women centre stage and telling the unique story of their lived experiences. I hope it will inspire commuters and visitors travelling in our city as we build a better London for everyone.""

Eleanor Pinfield, Head of Art on the Underground, said: ""Claudette Johnson's new artwork honours the Black female experience through this bold triptych, continuing Art on the Underground's exploration of contemporary responses to muralism at Brixton station. Johnson combines a monolithic scale with an intimacy in our encounter with her subjects. For this commission, Johnson has referenced work she made in the 1980s, a period of wide expansion of muralism through south London. Johnson's expressive new work will be enjoyed by millions of people using the Underground station each day.""

Cllr Donatus Anyanwu, Lambeth's Cabinet Member for Stronger Communities, said: ""I'm delighted this new mural by Claudette Johnson has been installed at Brixton Tube station where thousands of our residents will be able to enjoy it as they travel on the London Underground or visit the town centre. It's such a prominent location and a wonderful opportunity to celebrate Claudette's incredible artistic achievements, particularly as we're currently marking Black History Month.""

Claudette Johnson has been nominated for the 2024 Turner Prize, one of the world's most prestigious art awards. Her work is currently included in The Turner Prize exhibition at Tate Britain, alongside fellow nominees Pio Abad, Jasleen Kaur and Delaine Le Bas. The prize will be awarded on 3 December 2024 at a ceremony at Tate Britain, and the exhibition runs until 16 February and is just three stops away from Brixton on the Victoria line, in Pimlico.

A founding member of the BLK Art Group in Wolverhampton in the early 1980s, Johnson is one of the foremost figurative artists working in Britain today.

Initiated in 2018, the mural programme at Brixton Underground station invites artists to respond to the diverse narratives of the area, in recognition of the local murals painted in the 1980s.",0.17048894071226772,Fri,0.97,1.19,1.03,1.01,NA,NA,0.86,0.99,0.88,1.01890756302521,0.9983221476510067,0.9784673844205194,1.0073138297872342,NA,NA,0.9684684684684685,1.009517335146159,1.0038022813688212,1.0260148656375072,1.0186823992133727,0.9947145187601958,1.0161794697484705,NA,NA,0.9978831830654645,1.0361344537815127,1.0275291911702036

HGVs over 12 tonnes now required to be at least three-star rated, or fit a Progressive Safe System (PSS) of vehicle safety measures, in order to operate in Greater London  
In 2023, there was a 62 per cent reduction in the number of vulnerable road users killed by an HGV, compared to the 2017-19 baseline  
Improving vehicle safety features will further reduce the level of risk to all road users 
Transport for London (TfL) has today (28 October 2024) strengthened the requirements for its world-leading Direct Vision Standard (DVS), which is playing a vital role in helping to save the lives of vulnerable road users in the capital. DVS measures how much an HGV driver can see directly through their cab windows and sets minimum standards, to promote visibility and safe driving practices. TfL is now strengthening the minimum safety requirements for vehicles in the capital to reduce the level of risk that HGVs can pose to all road users, especially people walking and cycling.

HGVs over 12 tonnes will now require a minimum three-star DVS rating or to fit an updated system of enhanced safety features - the Progressive Safe System (PSS) - to operate in Greater London. Operators will receive a penalty charge notice of up to £550 if they operate an HGV over 12 tonnes in Greater London without a valid HGV safety permit, or do not meet the permit conditions. TfL has introduced these changes to further enhance the safety standards of HGVs operating in the capital, helping them to reduce road danger for everyone.

The DVS and HGV Safety Permit Scheme is a key part of the Mayor of London's Vision Zero plan to eliminate all deaths and serious injuries on London's transport network, and this next phase of the scheme harnesses new technology to make London's roads safer. The PSS has been designed specifically to eliminate the most common causes of fatal collisions between an HGV and those who walk and cycle where vision is a factor, such as when a vehicle moves off from stationary or is turning left.

TfL data shows that the DVS is already saving the lives of vulnerable road users. In 2023, there was a 62 per cent reduction in the number of fatal collisions involving an HGV, compared to the 2017-19 baseline, as well as reductions in serious injuries. However, more work is needed to keep Londoners safe. Six people were killed and 32 people were seriously injured in collisions involving HGVs in 2023, with devastating consequences for families, friends and communities.

The capital's DVS is a world first and is having an impact across the UK and EU. The work TfL has undertaken with manufacturers has already seen the EU incorporate direct vision into safety standards. The European Commission expects that this, along with other safety measures being introduced, will save an estimated 25,000 lives by 2038*.

Walking and Cycling Commissioner, Will Norman, said: ""London's world-leading Direct Vision Standard is helping to significantly improve lorry safety in the capital and is already saving the lives of vulnerable road users. However, every death and serious injury on our roads is one too many, which is why we are working with London Councils and industry to further strengthen the Direct Vision Standard to ensure lorries operating on London's roads are even safer.

""I'm immensely proud of our Direct Vision Standard, which is a major step forward in the Mayor's Vision Zero plan to eliminate all deaths and serious injuries from London's roads by 2041.""

Christina Calderato, TfL's Director of Strategy, said: ""Since we introduced London's pioneering Direct Vision Standard, we have seen a significant reduction in fatal collisions where vision is a factor in the capital. However, there is much more we need to do, to achieve our goal of eradicating deaths and serious injuries from London's transport network. It's vital that all vehicles using London's roads have safety at the forefront of their design and we're excited that from today HGVs operating in the capital will become even safer. We'd also like to thank the freight industry for their work helping to ensure that vehicles fit the new safety requirements.""

Andrew Cox, Managing Director, FM Conway, said: ""As a key infrastructure services provider across London, our vehicles spend a lot of time on the capital's streets. The bigger the vehicle, the bigger the challenge is to establish clear visibility for drivers to prevent collisions and accidents.

""TfL's DVS and its latest Progressive Safe System update, makes sure the largest vehicles operating on the network can do so safely, with driver and technology working in tandem to pre-emptively predict and avoid incidents.

""Health and safety should be a core value for any HGV operator, and TfL with their Vision Zero strategy are making sure that we are making the capital a safer place.""

Cllr Kieron Williams, London Councils' Executive Member for Climate, Transport and Environment, said: ""London boroughs have backed this change unanimously because it will save lives.  Deaths involving heavy goods vehicles have reduced by 62 per cent in 2023, directly because of Direct Vision Standard, which is a huge step forwards for our city. This further rise in safety standards will save even more lives.""

TfL's DVS has been developed in close consultation with the freight industry and vehicle manufacturers. The current Safe System of additional safety measures was developed and consulted on in 2018, and reviewed by TfL in 2022 to reflect new equipment and technologies available on the market. TfL consulted operators, manufacturers, suppliers, road user safety groups, industry and other stakeholders on its PSS proposals between 14 February and 3 April 2023. The consultation showed an encouraging level of support (more than 55 per cent) for the principles of DVS, the HGV Safety Permit Scheme and the principles underpinning the PSS.

TfL has also worked closely with the freight industry to monitor hauliers' readiness to fit PSS measures ahead of the new requirements coming in. In order to give the industry sufficient time to buy, fit, and test any new safety equipment in line with the new PSS, operators were able to apply for a six-month grace period before the standards were tightened this week. ",0.28083212435368016,Mon,0.97,1.23,1.06,1.02,NA,NA,0.8,1.01,0.9,1.01890756302521,1.0318791946308725,1.006966434452185,1.0172872340425534,NA,NA,0.9009009009009009,1.0299116247450715,1.026615969581749,1.0260148656375072,1.0529238243970156,1.0236867862969006,1.0262406526172672,NA,NA,0.9282634261074089,1.057066462948816,1.0508821273331628

TfL will support the annual London Poppy Day on the 31 October with collections from 07:00 to 19:00 at 70 stations across the capital
Comedian and musician Bill Bailey and actor, author, presenter and the Royal British Legion's Ambassador Ross Kemp will support Transport for London's (TfL's) fundraising efforts for the London Poppy Day on 31 October as TfL pays tribute to servicemen and women in collaboration with the Royal British Legion (RBL).

Marking London Poppy Day, poppies will return to London's transport network. Continuing the decades-long collaboration with the RBL, TfL will support their aim of raising over £1m though the annual London Poppy Day with collections from 07:00 to 19:00 at 70 stations across the capital.

As the 'voice' of the London Poppy Appeal, musician and comedian Bill Bailey has recorded special station announcements encouraging customers to support the cause, which will be played across the London Underground and rail network on London Poppy Day on 31 October, while actor, author and presenter Ross Kemp will support the collections at Charing Cross Underground station. London Transport Commissioner Andy Lord and London Transport Old Comrades will also support fundraising efforts outside Tower Wharf to support the RBL's activity for this year.

In support of the London Poppy Day, the IFS Cloud Cable Car cabins will be wrapped with poppies for the first time this year. TfL's network will also host poppy theme-wrapped buses, poppy decals on the front of trains across the DLR, Underground, Overground and Elizabeth line. Poppy roundels will decorate select bus stations, Underground and Overground platforms and eight piers across the city will host flags in support of the armed forces and veterans.

The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said: ""I'm proud that once again TfL is supporting the London Poppy Appeal, which will see celebrities Bill Bailey and Ross Kemp fundraising alongside the thousands of volunteers who help to make the day happen.""

""I encourage commuters to give whatever they can to this year's Poppy Appeal. These donations help the Royal British Legion provide crucial support to those who have done so much to serve our country, whether veterans, serving members of the armed forces, or their families.""

London's Transport Commissioner, Andy Lord, said: ""We are extremely proud to continue supporting the Royal British Legion in their fundraising efforts that support serving personnel, veterans and their families. We hope customers will spot our poppy tributes while they use the transport network and reflect on the service and sacrifice of our armed forces.""

Lucy Inskip, Director of the Poppy Appeal, said: ""We're excited that the Royal British Legion's London Poppy Day is in its 18th year, and we invite people across the city to come and say hello to the many members of the military community who will be collecting for the Poppy Appeal in major transport hubs through the day. Your poppy shows you care and that the service and sacrifice of serving Armed Forces personnel, veterans, and their families will never be forgotten.""

The London Poppy Appeal is the biggest street collection of its kind in the UK. Manned by more than 2,000 Poppy Appeal collectors and Armed Forces personnel from the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force, these collection stations are a unique opportunity for the public to interact with service personnel.

As a member of the Armed Forces Covenant, TfL takes pride in supporting the London Poppy Appeal and the veterans who work on the transport network. Their service has given them the critical skills required to effectively carry out their role as bus controllers, drivers, engineers and project managers.

This year, past and present members of the London Transport Old Comrades will march in the Remembrance Sunday Parade honouring the 4,500 transport staff who died in both wars and other conflicts.

London's transport network will join the rest of the UK and fall silent at 11:00 on Armistice Day on 11 November to remember those who have made the ultimate sacrifice for their country.

Donations can be made using contactless payment methods to the London Poppy Appeal, helping the RBL provide crucial support to veterans of the armed forces and their dependents. This support includes providing physical and mental health recovery and wellbeing services and financial and employment advice. The RBL also campaigns for better treatment of serving and ex-serving personnel.",0.27659399440504373,Tue,0.95,1.19,1.05,1,NA,NA,0.85,1,0.9,0.9978991596638656,0.9983221476510067,0.9974667511082964,0.9973404255319149,NA,NA,0.9572072072072072,1.0197144799456153,1.026615969581749,1.0048599199542596,1.0186823992133727,1.0140293637846656,1.0061182868796736,NA,NA,0.9862798902391219,1.0466004583651642,1.0508821273331628
2024-10-30,Oct, Transport for London announces bold plans to grow and improve toilet provision,"First phase of bold plan will see new free-to-use and accessible toilets introduced, alongside continued refurbishment of existing toilets across TfL network 
 
 




 ""Access to toilets is important for all customers when using public transport, but is a vital enabler for some, especially older customers, people with disabilities and those with young children.""
 
 Andy Lord
 London Transport Commissioner
 


 
In January, the Mayor of London announced the network's biggest ever dedicated investment in toilet provision of £3million per year over five years
TfL is committed to making toilets more accessible for everyone and has been engaging with customers, campaigners and staff to ensure passengers are always within 20 minutes of a toilet, without having to change trains
TfL is also looking to convert existing non-accessible toilets at Amersham, Green Park, Seven Sisters and Sudbury Hill stations to have accessible facilities, during the first phase of the project
Transport for London (TfL) has announced its ambitious programme to increase and improve toilet provision on London's transport network, in support of TfL's Equity in Motion plan to make London's transport network more accessible, fair and inclusive. The plan will see new accessible toilets delivered across the network, and improvements made to many existing facilities.

Earlier this year, the Mayor announced the biggest dedicated investment in toilet provision that London's transport network has seen, totalling £3million per year over five years. This will be invested in improving and increasing the number of accessible toilets on the network.

TfL is committed to making toilets more accessible for everyone and closing the gap in existing toilet provision so that Tube, Overground and Elizabeth line customers are always within 20 minutes of a toilet without having to change train.* Following engagement with customers, campaigners and staff, a new programme has been developed to ensure new toilets benefit customers who need them most. Stations were then chosen according to a number of factors, including whether the location is a terminus station, operates night services, has step-free access, high passenger footfall, proximity to other toilets on the network, and onward connections. 

TfL is committed to creating new facilities and enhancing existing facilities, including reopening closed facilities, and improving the cleaning of facilities. Following the study, TfL has shortlisted a number of locations for new toilet provision in the first round of works:

Camden Road Overground station
Clapton Overground station
New Cross Gate London Overground station
South Tottenham London Overground station
White Hart Lane Overground station
Morden Underground station
Hammersmith Underground station
TfL and the Mayor recognise that the provision of toilets is critical to many customers, sometimes determining whether a customer can travel by public transport at all. This is why TfL is also looking to convert a further four existing non-accessible toilets to accessible facilities within this first phase of the project at Amersham, Green Park and Sudbury Hill Underground stations and Seven Sisters Overground station, improving availability at other busy toilets that are currently misused or vandalised. TfL has also made improvements to more than one-third of London Underground stations with toilet provision in recent years, including repairing faults and re-painting areas.

Construction work to deliver new and accessible toilets at these stations is expected to start at several locations within the next year, following detailed assessments to determine viability.

The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said: ""Toilet provision is critical for many Londoners and visitors, and can even determine whether somebody travels on public transport at all. That's why I'm planning to make the biggest ever investment to increase toilet provision across TfL services and boost accessibility. I'm pleased that the first round of my funding will enable toilet provision in new stations as well as upgrading current facilities - helping us to build a better, fairer London for everyone.""

Andy Lord, London Transport Commissioner, said: ""Access to toilets is important for all customers when using public transport, but is a vital enabler for some, especially older customers, people with disabilities and those with young children.

""We have developed a plan for a holistic multi-year programme to improve toilet facilities across the TfL network. This includes new facilities at stations currently without toilets, more accessible toilets, enhancing existing facilities and increasing the availability and accessibility of toilets. Our programme delivery team is now hard at work to turn this plan into improvements for our customers across the network.""

John McGeachy Campaigns Manager at Age UK London, said: ""One on five people do not leave home as much as they would like to, because of consideration around a lack of public toilets - it's called the 'loo leash'. When it comes to the transport network, that can mean some people deciding not to make a particular journey. Older people, like people of all ages, travel for work, for volunteering, to care for others, to shop, to volunteer, for health appointments, for social activities, to visit friends and much more - it can never be the case that a lack of loos becomes a barrier to any of those journeys.

""That's why the launch of TfL's programme and plan today is so welcome. We're grateful to the Mayor, Deputy Mayor and staff across TfL for making the plan happen. The tireless work from campaigners for better provision has also been crucial. Public toilets are not something we talk about too often but the reality is that better provision can transform lives. If the plan is delivered in full it will make London much more welcoming for people of all ages.""

There are currently toilets available at 145 TfL sites with an additional 40 toilets within stations on the network that are not managed by TfL. TfL has created a handy Toilet Tube Map, which shows all the toilet facilities across the TfL network, including baby changing facilities and those which are wheelchair accessible.

Staff are on hand in stations to advise customers of the nearest public and accessible toilet where toilets are not available to customers at the station, and to grant access to accessible toilets that may require a RADAR key. Disabled people can request a universal key called a RADAR key from Disability Rights UK which they can keep with them when they travel.  

All toilets across the TfL network are cleaned at least twice a day. Customers can report anything in relation to toilets to any member of station staff and TfL is also developing a toilet best practice design guide to ensure that any new or upgraded toilets meet relevant standards and regulations and are easy to maintain and less prone to abuse.  

TfL will now continue detailed assessments to determine the viability of work at each site.

2024-10-31,Oct, Customers urged to check before they travel as RMT and ASLEF union members plan strike action on the Tube in November,"Strike action by RMT and ASLEF unions is planned across the London Underground network
 
 




 ""We are disappointed that the RMT and ASLEF unions have announced strike action, following our recent discussions over pay, terms and conditions.""
 
 Claire Mann
 TfL's Chief Operating Officer
 


 
TfL working to resolve the dispute with the unions and avoid disruption
If the strikes go ahead, little to no Tube service is expected Tuesday 5 to Friday 8 November, and on Tuesday 12 November
No Tube service expected on Thursday 7 November
Other TfL services, including the London Overground and DLR, are not on strike, but may be impacted by station closures
Transport for London (TfL) is urging customers to check before they travel ahead of planned strike action by RMT and ASLEF union members. TfL is working hard to resolve the dispute, with dialogue with the unions ongoing, and will operate as many services as possible, should strikes go ahead. TfL urges the unions to accept the offer and call off this action.

Most London Underground lines are not expected to run between 5 and 8 November, and on 12 November. Should the action go ahead, no Tube service is expected on Thursday 7 November. Customers are advised to visit tfl.gov.uk/strikes for the latest information.

Elizabeth line and London Overground services will be operating, but will be busier than normal and queuing systems may be in place. These services, as well as the DLR and London Trams, are expected to run as normal, but the closure of Tube stations may mean some services will be unable to stop at all stations or run to their normal destination. Buses will run as normal, but are expected to be busier than usual. 

Claire Mann, TfL's Chief Operating Officer, said: ""We are disappointed that the RMT and ASLEF unions have announced strike action, following our recent discussions over pay, terms and conditions. We are continuing to talk with all trade unions to discuss the issues and seek a resolution. Our offer is fair for our people and affordable for London.

""We urge the trade unions to call off this action, accept our offer, and avoid disruption to London. If it goes ahead customers should check before they travel as on some days during the strike there will be little to no service.""

TfL is working hard to try to resolve the disputes with the RMT and ASLEF unions. This action on London Underground comes following a revised offer with an average uplift of 4.6 per cent, which rewards staff for their hard work and benefits the lowest-paid staff the most. TfL has also proposed additional improvements, including increased paternity leave. 

Travel advice for November 

The planned strike action will affect London Underground services on the following days:

Sunday 3 November: Services will finish earlier than normal. Customers are advised to complete journeys by 17:00. There will be no service after 19:00.

Monday 4 November: Services will run as normal but customers are advised to check before they travel.

Tuesday 5 November and Wednesday 6 November: Severe disruption is expected with most lines not running on London Underground. Any services that do operate are likely to start later and finish earlier than normal.

Thursday 7 November: No London Underground services expected to operate.

Friday 8 November: Severe disruption is expected with most lines not running on London Underground. Any services that do operate are likely to start later and finish earlier than normal.

Saturday 9 November: London Underground services are expected to start later than normal.

Tuesday 12 November: Severe disruption is expected with most lines not running on London Underground. Any services that do operate are likely to start later and finish earlier than normal.

As customers seek alternative routes to travelling on London Underground, other transport services, and roads, will be extremely busy and subject to delay. Customers who need to travel are advised to plan ahead, and to consider walking and cycling where possible. If using public transport, customers should check before they travel, and allow extra time to complete their journey.",0.27678617329638755,Thu,0.94,1.14,1.02,0.98,NA,NA,0.83,0.99,0.88,0.9873949579831932,0.9563758389261745,0.9689677010766308,0.9773936170212767,NA,NA,0.9346846846846846,1.009517335146159,1.0038022813688212,0.9942824471126357,0.9758806177338192,0.9850570962479608,0.9859959211420802,NA,NA,0.9630733045864367,1.0361344537815127,1.0275291911702036
2024-10-31,Oct, TfL invites bidders to install and operate solar farms for the Tube network,"From 31 October, TfL invites bidders to be the delivery partner to invest in and set up solar farms for the Tube network
 
 




 ""The Mayor has ambitious goals to cut London's carbon footprint, so powering London's world-leading transport system with green energy is a clear win-win""
 
 Mete Coban
 Deputy Mayor for Environment and Energy
 


 
These solar farms could provide up to 64 MW of clean energy, which is around five per cent of the electricity needed to run the Tube network 
Unlocking renewable energy sources in London will create green jobs and increase the UK's renewable energy market confidence
This is part of the wider ambition to use 100 per cent renewable source electricity across TfL's operations by 2030
Transport for London (TfL) is seeking a delivery partner to work collaboratively to develop purpose-built solar farms to connect to the London Underground network, with opportunities for a broader connection to TfL's estate. Bidders are invited to participate in a competitive tender, which opens from 31 October.  

Following the conclusion of this tender, the appointed delivery partner will design and deliver proposals for solar developments that could bring up to 64 megawatts (MW) of electricity to the network, which is approximately five per cent of the electricity needed to run the Tube network. The project will explore developing and connecting solar infrastructure near the TfL network, facilitating development of assets at scale, contributing to the wider ambition to use 100 per cent renewable source electricity across TfL's operations by 2030.   

By entering into private wire agreements with a dedicated delivery partner, TfL will directly receive zero-carbon electricity from a local facility, bypassing the National Grid's centralised sources and Distribution Network Operators (DNOs) and reducing pressure on the central electricity grids. In the longer term, private wire schemes could generate financial savings, bypassing some of the costs associated with delivery of power through the National Grid.   

TfL is the largest single electricity consumer in London with a demand of approximately 1.6 Terawatt hours (TWh) per year, which is equivalent to the electricity consumed by around 420,000 homes [1] or 12 per cent of homes across London. The project will increase solar energy generation, stimulating the market for green jobs and creating greater market security and confidence. By harvesting renewable energy opportunities and working towards 100 per cent renewable-sourced electricity, this initiative will help to deliver the Mayor's target of a net zero carbon London by 2030.    

Lilli Matson, TfL's Chief Safety Health Environment Officer, said: ""As London's strong, green heartbeat, we're unlocking new ways to make our network and the energy we consume greener. We're inviting bidders to help us deliver purpose-built solar photovoltaic (PV) farms for the Tube network, in a move to make the energy we use and rely on cleaner, greener and potentially more cost-efficient.    

""By opening up new opportunities in the energy market and creating green jobs along the way, this is a start of a long-term journey to decarbonise London's iconic transport system. We want to stay ahead of the curve and make a significant contribution to the acceleration of Great Britain's grid transition towards net zero.""     

Mete Coban, Deputy Mayor for Environment and Energy, said: ""The Mayor has ambitious goals to cut London's carbon footprint, so powering London's world-leading transport system with green energy is a clear win-win. Installing solar panels as a source of renewable energy is one of many ways organisations in London can lower their carbon footprint.

""Not only will the solar panels help TfL to cut running costs and save passengers money, they will also create green jobs while helping TfL to reduce its carbon emissions.  

""This is a great opportunity for organisations to work with us as we build a greener, fairer London for everyone."" 

Frank Gordon, Director of Policy at The Association for Renewable Energy and Clean Technology, said: ""We welcome this innovative approach from TfL to procuring renewable power for their network, as well as the wider ambition to use 100 per cent renewable source electricity across TfL's operations by 2030.

""As one of the largest procurers of electricity in the South East this is a considerable opportunity for the solar industry to partner with a leading public organisation and start to roll out innovative solutions for decarbonising our energy supplies. As the UN's recent warnings on likely future temperature rise make clear, the time for such action is now and has never been more clear both environmentally but also economically, with the spikes in fossil fuel bills in recent times."" 

Rosie Allen, Policy Adviser at the Green Alliance, said: ""It's exciting to see this innovation into powering London's Tube network with solar. TfL is continuing to trailblaze on sustainable transport. Soon the District Line won't be the only green route on the Tube!""

As part of wider work to drive sustainability across London, TfL is investing in further decarbonising its operations, including transitioning its support vehicles and buses. It continues to work towards the Mayor's commitment to have a fully zero-emission bus fleet by 2030, which is acting as a catalyst for new production models and is helping to transform the bus industry in the UK.   

TfL is working to remove fossil fuels across its buildings, as well as developing wider projects to improve energy efficiency and identify opportunities to generate renewable energy across its estate. Work to procure Power Purchase Agreements, which aims to purchase a significant proportion of TfL's required electricity from renewable energy sources via the grid is well underway.  

TfL is also converting lighting within stations, bus shelters and on trains to LEDs, which use up to 60 per cent less energy than traditional lighting, while achieving around a 10 per cent increase in brightness. Currently, more than a third of Tube stations across London have been converted to LED lighting, and TfL expects to have all bus shelters, including those used in advertising panels, converted to LEDs in the coming months.   

For construction projects, TfL is taking an active approach to decarbonisation by recently signing up to the Construction Leadership Council's Five Client Carbon Commitments. This involves setting out actions under a common framework on how to reduce carbon emissions from its construction activities. The Five Client Carbon Commitments are:    

Procure for low carbon construction and provide incentives in our contracts  
Set phase out dates for fossil fuel use  
Eliminate the most carbon intensive concrete products  
Eliminate the most carbon intensive steel products  
Adopt PAS 2080, Carbon Management in Infrastructure, as a common standard.  
TfL is already making progress to include low carbon requirements in our contracts, reducing carbon in major construction projects like Old Street, Neasden and Surrey Quays. TfL also continues to improve processes in early stages of construction and taking a structured, phased approach to decarbonisation, including reducing the 25 per cent of embodied carbon emissions from steel and 20 per cent of the same from concrete materials on site and work towards emission-free deliveries by 2030 and diesel-free sites by 2035.      

The TfL Corporate Environment Plan, launched in 2021, explains how TfL will help make London a net zero carbon city by 2030 and achieve the environmental outcomes of the Mayor's Transport Strategy. TfL is delivering measures to clean London's toxic air such as the London-wide Ultra Low Emission Zone, the growing numbers of greener buses and zero emission capable taxis.

TfL's photocard website was made temporarily unavailable on 1 September following the detection of a highly sophisticated cyber security incident
Applications for 60+ and 5-10, 11-15 and 16+ Zip photocards will reopen throughout this month, with expired 5-10 and 11-15 Zip Oyster photocards continuing to be accepted on TfL and train operating companies across London where they are normally valid until 31 December 2024
Once customers have successfully applied for a new photocard, TfL will advise on how to claim for any additional travel costs incurred while the photocard website has been unavailable
Transport for London (TfL) has now begun accepting applications for 18+ Oyster photocards and several other concessions, as it continues to restore services following a recent highly sophisticated cyber security incident.

TfL prioritises the security of its network and customer data, continually monitoring its systems to ensure only those authorised can gain access.  On 1 September, TfL identified suspicious activity and took immediate action to secure its network, ensuring all safety critical systems and processes were maintained.  TfL has worked closely with the National Crime Agency and the National Cyber Security Centre throughout this process and notified the Information Commissioner's Office.

As part of the measures implemented to deal with the incident, TfL took the difficult decision to temporarily pause new concession photocard applications while it undertook important security checks.  While work continues to restore services, TfL has now safely brought back online its concession photocard website and begun to start processing new applications.

To ensure that those who are currently being financially impacted by the cyber incident are processed as quickly as possible, TfL will be phasing applications for concession photocards. From today (Monday 4 November), those applying for new 18+ Student; 18-25 Care Leaver and Apprentice Oyster photocards can submit applications again, and TfL will look to process these as quickly as it can.

The 18+ Student photocard allows customers to save 30 per cent on adult-rate Travelcards and Bus & Tram Pass season tickets if they are 18 or over, live in a London borough during term time and are enrolled at a school, college or university registered on the TfL scheme, or on a mandatory work placement in London.

In the coming weeks, TfL intends to start accepting new applications for new 60+ Oyster photocards applications, and by late November TfL will start to accept new applications for 5-10, 11-15 and 16+ Zip Oyster photocards. Once new photocards have been applied for, where possible, credit remaining on expired Zip photocards can be transferred across to new photocards by contacting TfL customer services. Customers are also advised to keep a record of any fares that they feel should be refunded. In addition, the postponed yearly address check, which are required for holders of 60+ Oyster photocards, will also start again later this year and TfL will write to customers to confirm when this will begin. Customers needing to apply for a Freedom Pass can continue to do so via London Councils.

As previously announced, TfL and train operating companies across London continue to accept expired 5-10 and 11-15 Zip Oyster photocards, where they are normally valid, in light of the cyber security incident until 31 December 2024, giving expired Zip photocard holders plenty of time to apply for their new concession photocard. Parents and guardians of those with expired Zip photocards have been emailed to inform them of this, and posters in TfL stations have also been updated. TfL and train operating companies have also informed bus drivers and all gateline staff of this change.

TfL intends to refund customers who have paid more for their travel than they should have due to TfL not being able to accept new photocard applications. Once new photocards have been issued, TfL will provide information on how customers can apply for refunds for any additional travel costs incurred due to not being able to apply for a photocard.

Deputy Mayor for Transport, Seb Dance, said:

'TfL has been working incredibly hard around the clock to restore the services which had to be temporarily taken offline while it responded to a highly sophisticated cyber attack. The Mayor and I commend TfL on its response, which has kept London moving and avoided the consequences of the attack being even worse.

'We're really pleased TfL has now started accepting Oyster photocard applications for several concessions, including 18+ Student and 18 - 25 Care Leavers, and are assured work is ongoing to ensure that other photocard applications are opened as quickly as possible in the coming weeks.'

Shashi Verma, Chief Technology Officer at TfL said:

'Following the recent highly sophisticated cyber security incident, we have been working to restore systems which we had to take offline as part of our mitigations. We're now pleased that we can restart processing Oyster photocard applications for students and will also work to ensure that other photocard applications can start being processed as quickly as possible. Once customers have successfully applied for a new Oyster photocard, we will also contact them to advise on how to claim for any additional travel costs incurred while the photocard website has been unavailable.'

Goksu Danaci, President of the Students' Union at University College London (UCL) said: 

'The 18+ Student Oyster is a vital initiative for our students and we're relieved this issue, caused by a recent cyber-attack, is coming to an end. Students have had a difficult start to the academic year with continuing cost of living pressures, and travel costs are a large part of a students daily expense. We're pleased TfL is now accepting 18+ Student Photocards applications again and has committed to refund students for any additional costs they've incurred during the time applications have been unavailable.'

As well as Oyster photocard applications, TfL continues to restore services following the recent cyber security incident. While most customer-facing services were not affected, there has been some disruption, with customers unable to access their contactless journey history, correct incomplete journeys or apply for service delay refunds. In addition, TfL has not been able to respond to some Santander Cycles customer enquiries, including processing refunds for customers who have been overcharged for using Santander Cycles. Work to restore these systems as quickly as possible is underway and TfL will keep customers up to date as this work progresses.

A veteran warship, HMS Belfast is the only remaining British Navy warship from D-Day 
Customers using TfL services can now benefit from 2-for-1 entry
TfL's partnerships with leading attractions across the capital aim to encourage people to use public transport to explore London's cultural gems
Transport for London (TfL) is partnering with Imperial War Museums' HMS Belfast to offer customers 2-for-1 entry for simply travelling by public transport.*

Built in 1936, HMS Belfast is now an iconic London landmark, permanently moored on the River Thames. With nine decks to explore, visitors can hear stories of life onboard from the 900 crew who called it home, take a seat in the Captain's chair and delve into the armoured heart of the ship to see the machinery held within. HMS Belfast was the largest of the Royal Navy's Town-class light cruisers and had a rich and varied life having fired some of the opening shots on D-Day, protected Arctic convoys and supported Allied troops in the Korean War.

In addition to its naval past, HMS Belfast has played a more contemporary role in recent popular culture having been part of the 2012 Olympic Games celebrations, featured in the announcement of Daniel Craig as James Bond in 2005, the BBC's Killing Eve and an Eminem performance of Toy Soldiers.  Located right across from the Tower of London and St Paul's Cathedral, HMS Belfast is just a short walk from London Bridge Underground station and other cultural and historic highlights in the heart of the city.

Julie Dixon, Head of Customer Information, Design and Partnerships at TfL, said: ""London is brimming with amazing historical and cultural attractions, and we hope that our partnership with HMS Belfast will encourage even more Londoners and visitors to discover this iconic warship. With many of us looking for new experiences, this offer is a great way of enjoying one of the city's cultural gems and unique attractions for less.""

Daniel Schnable, HMS Belfast Site Manager, said: ""HMS Belfast is so much more than a museum, it is a historic site, a witness to the world during the most challenging times of the twentieth century, and an iconic London landmark. A whole day can be spent navigating its many rooms and climbing the ladders down to the depths of the Shell Room, right to the top of the Gun Direction Platform, and discovering the real human stories of those who served onboard. We are thrilled to be partnering with TfL to encourage more people to visit HMS Belfast and gain a fascinating window into Britain's naval history.""

To celebrate, TfL joins forces with Barclays Women's Super League to promote a historic weekend for women's football, as all games in Barclays Women's Super League and Barclays Women's Championship will be played in main stadiums for the very first time
This includes top-table clashes on Saturday 16 November as Tottenham Hotspur host Arsenal and Chelsea host Manchester City
Fans travelling to these games will be treated to special station announcements by Barclays Women's Super League star players Alex Greenwood, Bethany England, Lotte Wubben-Moy and Lucy Bronze
Transport for London (TfL) is teaming up with the Barclays Women's Super League to celebrate the naming of the London Overground Lioness line and a historic weekend for women's football. Station announcements from star players on Saturday 16 November at Fulham Broadway, Seven Sisters and White Hart Lane stations will welcome fans to two blockbuster matches in the capital.

History will be made this weekend with all games in Barclays Women's Super League and Barclays Women's Championship set to be played in main stadiums for the very first time. This includes top table clashes between Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal, and Chelsea and Manchester City at Tottenham Hotspur and Stamford Bridge stadiums on Saturday 16 November. To help celebrate this, fans travelling to these games will be treated to special station announcements from England Women's footballers Alex Greenwood, Bethany England, Lotte Wubben-Moy and Lucy Bronze.

Alongside these messages from England's finest, whiteboard messages will highlight the games and the upcoming launch of the London Overground Lioness line. The line runs through Wembley and honours the historic achievements and lasting legacy of the England women's football team, which continues to inspire and empower the next generation of women and girls in sport.

The naming of this London Overground line pays homage to the most successful senior team since 1966. This choice of name will help to cement their impact on society and keep the legacy alive for generations to come. Running between Watford Junction and Euston, the line connects fans to Wembley Stadium. Not only will this line draw attention to women's sport for fans travelling to England's national stadium, but also increase visibility of women's football amongst the millions of people who use Euston station.

To delve into the history behind the name for the London Overground Lioness line, TfL's Mind the Gap podcast invited Lionesses Chloe Kelly and Leah Williamson on the anniversary of the historic Euro 2022 win to speak about the history of their sport and recognising the impact of the new line name in helping young women and girls find their voice within sports and society at large.

Deputy Mayor for Transport, Seb Dance, said: ""I'm thrilled that TfL has partnered with Barclays Women's Super League to celebrate this historic weekend for women's football and mark the launch of the London Overground Lioness line. The line running from Watford to Euston commemorates the England women's football team's unforgettable Euros win in 2022, which sparked a step change in attitudes towards women's football all around the country and changed the football landscape forever.

""I hope fans enjoy this special weekend and reflect on how women's football continues to thrive, inspire and unite communities.""

Emma Strain, Customer Director at TfL, said: ""We're working with Barclays Women's Super League to mark this historic weekend for women's football as it comes as we get ready to launch the London Overground Lioness line soon. The line honours the historic achievements and lasting legacy of the England women's football team from 2022, which you can see today with tens of thousands of fans watching women's football in the capital this weekend. We hope that fans travelling to these matches will take a moment to appreciate how women's sport continues to grow, inspire and bring communities together.""

TfL and the Barclays Women's Super League are also supporting fans who want to catch both matches with advice on how to travel between the two stadiums, with a unique route illustration showing fans how easy it is to travel by public transport between the two stadiums with Tottenham Hotspur vs Arsenal kicking off at 13:45, and Chelsea vs Manchester City getting underway at 17:30 on Saturday 16 November.",0.19348651253327745,Wed,0.94,1.22,1.06,1,NA,NA,0.92,0.97,0.87,1.010752688172043,1.0113989637305698,1.004739336492891,1.008827238335435,NA,NA,0.9912457912457913,1.005181347150259,1.0043290043290043,0.9942824471126357,1.0443634681011047,1.0236867862969006,1.0061182868796736,NA,NA,1.0675029400235203,1.0152024446142094,1.015852723088724

Competition winners chosen by staff working along the London Overground Liberty line from a list of nominations put forward by Havering locals
The London Overground line that runs between Romford, Emerson Park and Upminster stations in Havering will soon become the Liberty line
This will make it easier for customers to navigate the network, while also celebrating the local area's diverse culture and history
Transport for London (TfL) has revealed the three winners of its community competition, celebrating the unsung heroes of Havering and marking the naming of the London Overground Liberty line later this year.

The three winners, Lauren Hayden, Rebecca Mazrreku and Weininger Irwin, were chosen by staff working on the London Overground line due to their outstanding contributions to the local community. They have been awarded special London Overground Liberty line prizes, including a trip in a driver's cab, a tour of a railway control centre in Romford and an invitation to see the first new London Overground Liberty line signs in place.

The name of the London Overground Liberty line is inspired by the unique history of Havering, which used to be a Royal Liberty between 1465 and 1982 and granted special freedoms to local residents. TfL encouraged Havering locals to nominate those who have gone above and beyond to support the local community to win special prizes.

Lauren Hayden was chosen as a Liberty line competition winner for going above and beyond as a mental health champion who is dedicated to tackling loneliness and creating inclusive spaces for people to flourish and grow. Lauren set up a community social group in Havering for over 55s that allows people to meet new friends, socialise in a warm environment, and take part in various activities such as chair yoga and talks from charitable groups.

Rebecca Mazrreku, Chair of Elm Park Community Association, played a pivotal role in transforming Elm Park Assembly Hall from a neglected space in danger of closing into a thriving community hub that regularly hosts events including craft fairs, exercise classes, a warm hub for elderly residents and faith groups. Rebecca's inclusive leadership, her dedication to a range of causes such as opening up volunteering opportunities to disabled people, and her resilience in the face of adversity, make her a true pillar of the community.

Weininger Irwin is the force behind 'Cool Rowings', an initiative in Romford that aims at improving physical and mental health through adaptive sports and rowing classes, particularly for underrepresented groups. Beyond this, Weininger supports numerous charitable causes, having raised thousands of pounds for Comic Relief and brought awareness to health issues such as prostate cancer. Weininger perfectly exemplifies an 'unsung hero', never seeking out personal recognition for his work but rather focusing on spreading the word about the benefits of exercise and the importance of inclusion.

Trish Ashton, Director of Rail Services at TfL, said: ""The new name of the London Overground Liberty line reflects not only Havering's rich cultural heritage but also its vibrant community spirit. Lauren, Rebecca and Weininger embody the very best of this spirit and it has been a privilege to learn about so many inspiring individuals through the community competition.""

Simone Gordon, Customer Experience Manager for the London Overground Weaver and Liberty lines at Arriva Rail London, said: ""It has been truly inspiring to read all the nominations, which are a testament to the strong community spirit that makes Havering so special. The competition winners are united by a passion for community service while representing the diversity of the borough and reminding us of the many ways that people can have a positive impact on those around them.""

Shelley Hart, Chief Executive Officer at Havering Volunteer Centre, said: ""The Liberty line competition has given well-deserved recognition to unsung heroes who dedicate their time to uplift others, and I hope their stories inspire others to get involved. The winners' dedication to making a difference shows the incredible impact that volunteers can have in transforming lives and strengthening communities.""",0.2388187418002471,Thu,0.94,1.2,1.06,1,NA,NA,0.95,0.98,0.88,1.010752688172043,0.9948186528497409,1.004739336492891,1.008827238335435,NA,NA,1.0235690235690236,1.0155440414507773,1.0158730158730158,0.9942824471126357,1.0272427555092833,1.0236867862969006,1.0061182868796736,NA,NA,1.102312818502548,1.025668449197861,1.0275291911702036
2024-11-15,Nov, State-of-the-art Kingston bus station to reopen after transformation,"Work to transform Cromwell Road bus station will improve overall customer experience, making it safer and more sustainable
 
 




 ""We're determined to make it even easier to use public transport in the capital and our work to transform Cromwell Road bus station has been a key part of our plans to strengthen the network in Kingston""
 
 Lorna Murphy
 TfL's Director of Buses
 


 
Improvements include enhanced LED lighting, better information screens and CCTV to improve safety and help people to feel more confident when using public transport
Sustainability improvements have made the bus station an energy-efficient building
Buses will strengthen Kingston's public transport network
The refurbished state-of the-art Cromwell Road bus station in Kingston re-opens on Saturday 16 November following a complete transformation, which includes the addition of a customer toilet, improved safety features such as CCTV and measures to improve the building's efficiency.

Transport for London (TfL) started work to redevelop the bus station last summer and customers will now benefit from improved real-time travel information screens and a fully accessible customer toilet. Safety improvements include enhanced LED lighting and CCTV in and around the station, a wider passenger island with more space for customers and a new PA system. There are also improved welfare facilities for bus drivers and staff, as well as a new retail unit. This brand-new bus station will make bus journeys in Kingston much more convenient, safe and attractive.

The bus station is also now an energy-efficient building with a new canopy in the waiting area to keep passengers warm and dry throughout the seasons. The pavements have been resurfaced and drainage improved with the installation of a sustainable urban drainage system - also known as SuDS. SuDS help to prevent the increasing risk of flooding by managing water runoff in a way that mimics natural processes, using extra vegetation and rain gardens. By having plants rather than concrete and absorbent paving, some of the water filters into the ground, slowing down the rate at which water enters the sewage system during periods of heavy rain.

Buses are the most affordable, accessible and available form of public transport in London, and are the main sustainable alternative to cars for journeys that can't easily be walked or cycled. The changes to Cromwell Road bus station are part of TfL's Bus Action Plan to make London's bus network even better, improving the customer experience and safety and enabling more people to use sustainable modes of transport. The station will serve a total of 32 bus routes, including Superloop service SL7, several night buses and a school and university bus

Seb Dance, Deputy Mayor for Transport, said: ""When the Mayor was elected for a third term he committed to strengthening public transport options in outer London to help build a better and fairer city for all Londoners. The transformation of Kingston bus station will be a gamechanger, with improved customer waiting areas, a toilet and new safety features to improve the customer experience and help people feel more confident when travelling by public transport.""

Lorna Murphy, TfL's Director of Buses, said: ""We're determined to make it even easier to use public transport in the capital and our work to transform Cromwell Road bus station has been a key part of our plans to strengthen the network in Kingston. The new bus station has been designed with customers in mind and we hope customers will be able to take advantage of the new and improved station and encourage more people to use local bus services. We thank the local community for their patience during the works and hope they enjoy their new station.""

Councillor Nicola Nardelli, Portfolio Holder for Transport and Highways at Royal Borough of Kingston Upon Thames, said: ""We are delighted to see the opening of our new state-of-the-art bus station in Kingston. Cromwell Road is a key piece of infrastructure in our transport network and the new bus station will make journeys easier, safer, more comfortable and more attractive for travellers.

""Buses remain the most affordable, accessible, and available form of public transport in Kingston, providing vital mobility for our residents and enhancing our connections across London. We are especially delighted that it delivers on so many of the priorities important to our borough, with leading sustainable design that incorporates safety, accessibility, energy efficiency and flood prevention during heavy rain.""",0.300860716894997,Fri,0.95,1.19,1.04,1,NA,NA,0.93,1.04,0.93,1.021505376344086,0.9865284974093264,0.9857819905213269,1.008827238335435,NA,NA,1.002020202020202,1.077720207253886,1.0735930735930737,1.0048599199542596,1.0186823992133727,1.0043719412724306,1.0061182868796736,NA,NA,1.0791062328498628,1.0884644766997709,1.0859115315776016
2024-11-19,Nov, Introduction of new London Overground line names and colours will soon start,"TfL updating signage at small number of stations with new line names and colours from 20 November, with the majority happening from 25 November
 
 




 ""This is an exciting step as millions of customer journeys on the London Overground will be transformed by making it simpler to navigate.""
 
 Andy Lord
 London's Transport Commissioner
 


 
Rollout follows a summer of customer engagement in preparation for the new line names 
Customers will soon start to find navigating the London Overground easier, with Transport for London (TfL) rolling out the new line names and colours from 20 November. 

From this date, the new line names and colours will start to be unveiled across TfL customer information channels and a small number of London Overground stations, with the majority being updated from 25 November. A phased approach is necessary due to the number of maps, diagrams and information systems being updated. This is one of the largest customer-focused projects TfL has ever undertaken to make the network easier to navigate for customers. 

TfL will update around 6,000 station wayfinding signs, Tube maps, station digital screens, onboard train information, Journey Planner and TfL Go. Audio and visual announcements on trains and stations will also be updated.  

The rollout is taking place as follows: 

Signage unveiled over nine days across the 113 stations that London Overground serves 
Updates to in-train maps and line diagrams across the London Overground fleet, and an upgrade to the audiovisual passenger information system on the Class 378 trains, which run on the Lioness, Mildmay and Windrush lines 
New Tube maps at all stations  
Online versions of maps live on the TfL website  
Updates to customer information screens and PA announcements at London Overground stations  
Digital channel updates, including the TfL website and TfL Go, will be updated in two phases which will be fully completed by mid-December 
The audiovisual passenger information system on the Class 710 trains will follow by January 2025 
Andy Lord, London's Transport Commissioner, said: ""This is an exciting step as millions of customer journeys on the London Overground will be transformed by making it simpler to navigate. Individual line colours and names have helped customers navigate the Tube for more than a hundred years, so we wanted to take a similar approach on the London Overground. These changes will help improve customer confidence when travelling and encourage more to use our services."" 

This is the first time each of the London Overground lines will be represented by a name and colour to make it easier for customers to navigate London's transport network, while also celebrating the city's diverse culture and history.   

The new names and colours are:  

Lioness (running from Watford Junction to Euston) - yellow 
Mildmay (running from Richmond and Clapham Junction to Stratford) - blue 
Windrush (running from Highbury & Islington to New Cross, Clapham Junction, Crystal Palace and West Croydon) - red 
Weaver (running from Liverpool Street to Enfield Town, Cheshunt and Chingford) - maroon 
Suffragette (running from Gospel Oak to Barking Riverside) - green 
Liberty (running from Romford to Upminster) - grey 
Stakeholders, customers, staff, historians, industry experts and communities have played a key role in helping decide the names through engagement, which took place ahead of the decision on the final six names. London's diverse history and culture have always played a significant role in shaping the city, and it was important for the line names, which will be used for years to come, to reflect this.  

Throughout the summer, TfL has engaged with customers through a number of activities all designed to help people become familiar with the new London Overground line name and colours. This includes a new series of TfL's 'Mind the Gap' podcasts that delve into the history of each line name. These podcasts have been among the most popular TfL has produced, showing customers have taken a genuine interest in what's behind each of the names.   

TfL also teamed up with walking app Go Jauntly and launched six fascinating self-guided walks to help celebrate the new London Overground line names. Each one helps participants to delve into the stories behind each of the line names and visit points of interest while encouraging them to stay active. ",0.34964229737101343,Tue,0.87,1.16,1.05,0.94,NA,NA,0.89,1.02,0.92,0.935483870967742,0.9616580310880828,0.9952606635071088,0.9482976040353089,NA,NA,0.958922558922559,1.0569948186528497,1.0620490620490621,0.9202401372212693,0.9930013303256405,1.0140293637846656,0.9457511896668932,NA,NA,1.0326930615444925,1.0675324675324676,1.074235063496122
2024-11-19,Nov, GTS Rail Operations Limited announced as new operator for the Elizabeth line,"""I am delighted that we have appointed GTS Rail Operations to continue to build on the success of the Elizabeth line and I look forward to working with them.""
 
 Claire Mann
 TfL's Chief Operating Officer
 


 
Transport for London (TfL) has today announced its intention to award the new Elizabeth line operator contract to GTS Rail Operations Limited, a joint venture between Go Ahead Group, Tokyo Metro and Sumitomo Corporation. The contract will cover seven years with an option to extend for up to two additional years. 

GTS Rail Operations Limited will take over from the existing operator, MTR Corporation (Crossrail) Limited, in May 2025.  

The Elizabeth line is the most significant addition to London's transport network in a generation and has quickly become one of the most popular railways in the country, carrying more than 700,000 people a day. It has transformed life and travel in London and the South East by reducing journey times, creating additional capacity, and improving accessibility across London's transport network.  

The new contract with GTS Rail Operations Limited will enable TfL to build on the success of the Elizabeth line and ensure it continues to be a showcase for investment in public transport in London, across the country and around the world.  

The new concession operator contract will support and achieve this by: 

Bringing the best parts of Tokyo and London to the Elizabeth line to optimise the current operation and prepare for the increase in services to Old Oak Common when it is planned to open in 2030 
Continuing to have a relentless focus on the safety of customers and staff  
Encouraging robust collaboration between industry partners, including Network Rail, to deliver high levels of performance and customer satisfaction  
Investing in people and technology to drive improvements in operating performance and the management of disruption and customer information  
Bringing into service the 10 new Class 345 trains to support the introduction of additional service enhancements in response to increased passenger numbers and growth opportunities across London and the South East 
Working closely with other parts of TfL, Network Rail and HS2 to prepare for the operation of services to the new station at Old Oak Common 
Delivering more than 500 apprenticeships over the contract term, supporting strategic resourcing and training  
Offering grants to local community groups in order to support important grass roots movements 
Claire Mann, TfL's Chief Operating Officer, said: ""The Elizabeth line has had a transformational impact since opening in 2022 and has quickly become one of the most popular and reliable railways in the country. The railway has provided new, more direct journey options which has led to huge numbers of customers using our safe and accessible trains and stations.  

""I am delighted that we have appointed GTS Rail Operations to continue to build on the success of the Elizabeth line and I look forward to working with them.""  

Miguel Parras, Group CEO of the Go-Ahead Group, said: ""We're proud to have been chosen to be TfL's partner, together with Sumitomo Corporation and Tokyo Metro, for the operation of the iconic Elizabeth line. We look forward to bringing our collective expertise across UK and international rail operations to London. Our objectives are aligned with TfL - to connect communities across London through safe, reliable, and sustainable public transport services, delivered to the highest level of customer satisfaction.""",0.3323301700494682,Tue,0.87,1.16,1.05,0.94,NA,NA,0.89,1.02,0.92,0.935483870967742,0.9616580310880828,0.9952606635071088,0.9482976040353089,NA,NA,0.958922558922559,1.0569948186528497,1.0620490620490621,0.9202401372212693,0.9930013303256405,1.0140293637846656,0.9457511896668932,NA,NA,1.0326930615444925,1.0675324675324676,1.074235063496122
2024-11-20,Nov, High-speed charging technology powers safer new zero-emission buses on 358 route,"New electric buses charged by innovative pantograph technology now on London's roads
 
 




 ""Electrifying London's bus fleet is key to the Mayor's aims of cleaning up London's toxic air and making London a net-zero carbon city by 2030.""
 
 Mete Coban
 Deputy Mayor for the Environment
 


 
Striking new tram-like bus design includes enhanced safety and customer features
More than 1,700 zero-emission buses now in service in London
From today, Wednesday 20 November, new, stylish, tram-like buses powered by pantograph will be introduced in phases to one of London's longest bus routes, between Crystal Palace and Orpington. The forward-thinking pantograph technology on route 358 allows fast, high-power charging of the new buses at each end of the 15-mile journey, through an arm-like structure attached to the bus roof, in as little as six minutes. This means drivers do not return to garages to recharge.

This means fewer buses are required on the route, bringing savings that can be invested into other areas of TfL's network, in addition to the benefits of cleaner, greener travel.

As part of TfL's commitment to achieving the Mayor's Vision Zero goal of eliminating all deaths and serious injuries on London's roads, the buses have a safer front-end design, and include the latest safety features, such as speed limiting technology, audible warnings to alert pedestrians and other road users to the bus, and improved direct and indirect vision for drivers through camera monitoring instead of mirrors. The striking new design of the tram-style buses has an interior that is designed to reduce customer injuries including improved seat design and slip protection for flooring. The buses benefit from enhanced customer features such as USB charging ports and palm-operated assistance buttons.

TfL's zero-emission fleet is the largest in Western Europe, with more than 1,700 zero-emission buses in operation. Zero-emission buses help to tackle the dangers of toxic air pollution and tackle the climate emergency. Carrying up to 80 times the number of passengers as a car, while taking up just three times as much space, they also help to cut congestion. Route 358 is the latest milestone in the Mayor's commitment to deliver a zero-emission bus fleet by 2030.

Buses are critical to meeting sustainable transport, safety and environmental targets. They have a huge role to play in reducing congestion, making sustainable travel more attractive to everyone, and, across TfL's zero-emission bus fleet more widely, supporting jobs across the UK. London's iconic red bus fleet is one of the greenest in the world, with lower CO2 emissions per passenger kilometres compared to other global cities like New York, Paris and Vancouver.

Introducing new pantograph technology on the route 358 is part of TfL's plans to improve bus services across London by 2030. Alongside the target to transition to a fully zero-emission fleet, initiatives such as introducing 25km of new bus lanes by 2025 and better interchanges will help to deliver a faster and more efficient bus network for those travelling in the capital. Improved customer information and upgraded bus stops will enable a more inclusive passenger experience.

In 2023, TfL launched the Superloop, a game-changing network of 10 express bus services, linking stations, hospitals and transport hubs across outer London and adding more than six million kilometres per year to the bus network. Data shows that Superloop is already transforming travel with millions of journeys each year, with almost half of the journeys involving an interchange with another mode of public transport.  

Lorna Murphy, Director of Buses, TfL, said: ""The harmful effects of toxic air pollution in the capital are known to contribute to thousands of premature deaths and serious health conditions. Londoners deserve to breathe clean air, and it is vital that we continue to deliver solutions to address this.

""Installing new rapid-charging pantograph infrastructure on one of London's longest bus routes is an innovative step forward, helping us to run cleaner, greener services that get Londoners where they need to be.

""Working with partners across a range of different sectors on this project, we are showcasing how the broader shift to net zero can be achieved. The move to increase the number of zero-emission buses on the capital's streets is a key part of the Mayor's goal to make London a zero carbon city.""

Tom Joyner, Managing Director of Go-Ahead London said: ""I am incredibly proud of the strides we've made this year in our journey toward a zero-emission future. Go-Ahead London is leading the way in driving the transition to zero-emission buses, with 636 electric vehicles now operating across our network. This includes the exciting launch of the 358 route and the expansion of our pantograph technology, both strong testaments to our commitment to cleaner air and healthier communities.

""From 2024 to 2026 Go-Ahead Group of which Go-Ahead London is part of, will be investing £500 million to introduce even more electric buses, focusing on London, in support of TfL's net-zero targets. Our partnership with TfL ensures we can continue to serve our communities while setting new industry standards for sustainability. Together, we are not only transforming public transport but also creating a lasting positive impact.""

Iñigo Etxeberria, Managing Director of Irizar e-mobility, said: ""We are proud to be a partner on this project, which is another step forward in London's green transition. This creates a global showcase, is a milestone for our business and increases our prominence in the UK as an innovative company. It is a large-scale project that we are delighted to be implementing in this city. These twenty buses will electrify this ultra-fast opportunity charging bus line. We really hope that Londoners will enjoy the experience of travelling into the modern, sleek and sustainable Irizar ie tram buses. ""

Deputy Mayor for the Environment, Mete Coban said: ""Electrifying London's bus fleet is key to the Mayor's aims of cleaning up London's toxic air and making London a net-zero carbon city by 2030. London already has the largest zero-emission fleet in Western Europe, but our ambition is to achieve the Mayor's goal of the entire fleet being zero-emission by 2030. These state-of-the-art buses will benefit from technology to help them run for longer without being charged, making journeys more efficient, and will also feature multiple safety improvements. This is all part of our plans to continue building a safer, greener London for everyone.""

Liam Conlon, Member of Parliament for Beckenham and Penge, said: ""It's fantastic to see the Mayor introducing these new zero-emission buses. They are the first buses of their kind in the UK, and I'm delighted it's on the 358 route that runs through Beckenham and Penge. Local residents will benefit from safer travel and cleaner air as a result.

""In the months since being elected, people have made it clear to me that a greener London and improved road safety are top of their priority lists. That's why seeing the new 358 bus hit the roads is such a welcome sight.

""Today's launch represents great progress and shows what a greener, fairer London looks like in action. I look forward to continuing to work with the Mayor and our new Government to build on it.""

Rosie Allen, Policy Adviser, Green Alliance, said: ""Greener buses mean the same fare for cleaner air, so it's exciting to see new futuristic, tram-style fast-charging buses take on the 358 route. As they make their way across 15 miles of South London streets, charging at either end, they'll prove that here is no route too long for electric buses, and point the way to a future free of fossil fuels for transport.""

Ben Curtis, Head of External Affairs at Campaign for Better Transport said: ""Buses are our most used form of sustainable transport and bus electrification is key to cutting road emissions and cleaning our air. It's fantastic to see how innovative technology like pantograph charging can be used to keep TfL buses green and efficient and support operation on longer routes on the network.""",0.34865697468868273,Wed,0.91,1.19,1.04,0.97,NA,NA,0.89,0.97,0.88,0.9784946236559141,0.9865284974093264,0.9857819905213269,0.9785624211853721,NA,NA,0.958922558922559,1.005181347150259,1.0158730158730158,0.9625500285877645,1.0186823992133727,1.0043719412724306,0.9759347382732835,NA,NA,1.0326930615444925,1.0152024446142094,1.0275291911702036

This follows applications recently restarting for 60+ London residents, as well as 18+ Students, Apprentices and 18-25 Care Leavers living in London
More than 40,000 photocards have been dispatched since online systems reopened, following A temporary pause due to the recent cyber security incident
Expired 5-10 and 11-15 Zip Oyster photocards will continue to be accepted on TfL and train operating company services where normally valid until 31 December 2024. Parents and guardians advised to apply for cards as soon as possible 
TfL will shortly write to affected photocard customers to advise how to claim for any additional travel costs incurred while the photocard website was unavailable
Applications for new 5-10, 11-15 and 16+ Zip Oyster photocards are now being accepted by Transport for London (TfL), after they were temporarily paused following a recent highly sophisticated cyber security incident.

The acceptance of new applications for Zip cards follows TfL reopening systems for 60+ London Oyster photocards, 18+ Student Oyster photocards and other concessions in recent weeks, and means customers can now apply for all photocard concessions again.

TfL prioritises the security of its network and customer data, continually monitoring its systems to ensure only those authorised can gain access.  On 1 September, TfL identified suspicious activity and took immediate action to secure its network, ensuring all safety critical systems and processes were maintained.  TfL has worked closely with the National Crime Agency and the National Cyber Security Centre throughout this process and notified the Information Commissioner's Office.

As part of the measures implemented to deal with the incident, TfL took the difficult decision to temporarily pause new concession photocard applications while it undertook important security checks. With the concession photocard website now fully back online again, TfL is working to process all new photocard applications as quickly as possible. Already, more than 30,000 18+ Student photocards, more than 10,000 60+ London Oyster photocards and nearly 600 Apprentice photocards have been processed and dispatched since applications reopened. 

As previously announced, TfL and train operating companies across London continue to accept expired 5-10 and 11-15 Zip Oyster photocards, where they are normally valid, in light of the cyber security incident until 31 December 2024. This gives expired Zip photocard holders plenty of time to apply for their new concession photocard. Parents and guardians of those with expired Zip photocards are encouraged to apply as soon as possible for a new photocard for their children or dependent to help ensure that they receive one before the end of the year. Expired photocards will not be accepted for travel on TfL or train operating company services from 1 January 2025.

As well as Oyster photocard applications, TfL continues to restore services following the recent cyber security incident where customers were unable to access their contactless journey history, correct incomplete journeys or apply for service delay refunds. TfL can now however process refunds for journeys made using Oyster card, and photocards - including those due where customers received maximum fares for not touching in or out correctly - and paper tickets. TfL hopes that it will be able to start processing refunds and corrections for journeys made using a contactless card or mobile device shortly and will keep customers up to date as this work progresses.

As previously announced, TfL intends to refund customers who have paid more for their travel than they should have, due to TfL not being able to accept new photocard applications. TfL plans to write to photocard customers who were impacted by not being able to apply for a new Photocard with further details about how to apply for refunds and the criteria for processing these.

Shashi Verma, Chief Technology Officer at TfL said: ""We're pleased that we can now accept photocard applications for all concessions managed by TfL and will be working hard to process these as quickly as possible. We apologise for any inconvenience that this has caused our customers.

""Following the recent highly sophisticated cyber security incident, we have been working to restore systems which we had to take offline as part of our mitigations. We are now able to start processing refunds for those requiring refunds for journeys made using Oyster or paper tickets. We hope to shortly contact all new photocard customers who those who were impacted by not being able to apply for their new photocard, as well as continue work to allow us to begin processing refunds for contactless journeys, and for customers to be able to see their full journey history again.""

2024-11-25,Nov," TfL and Met Police begin trial of CCTV at bus shelters to improve safety, especially for women and girls","Specially designed CCTV cameras at bus shelters will prevent and detect crime, and improve safety and security 
 
 




 ""Everyone deserves to feel safe and be safe at all times when travelling around London and it is the Mayor's top priority to ensure the transport network is a safe and low-crime environment.""
 
 Seb Dance 
 Deputy Mayor for Transport
 


 
Initiative part of TfL's wider efforts to ensure the whole network is safe and welcoming for customers and staff 
TfL proud to support White Ribbon Day by supporting customers and staff to speak up about male violence against women    
TfL also reviewing findings of 70 women's safety audits in five London boroughs conducted with MOPAC  
This White Ribbon Day (25 November), Transport for London (TfL) continues to take a stand against violence against women and girls by launching a 12-month trial of CCTV at 20 bus shelters across London, together with the Met.  

The trial is designed to improve passenger safety, especially for women and girls, and ensure they can travel with confidence 24 hours a day. Tackling violence against women and girls remains a key priority for TfL and the police, and this trial is a step towards delivering the Mayor's commitment to increase CCTV in bus shelters.    

The technology was tested at five bus shelters in March, and now a further 15 bus shelter locations have been fitted with CCTV across Brent, Croydon, Hackney, Hammersmith and Fulham, Hillingdon, Lambeth, Newham, Redbridge, Tower Hamlets, Waltham Forest, and Westminster. These locations were selected to provide good coverage across London and to understand the effectiveness of CCTV in different areas. This includes busy locations with high footfall, quieter locations with less frequent bus services, higher crime areas, or locations where women and girls have reported feeling more unsafe.      

The cameras will be available to the Met to help prevent and investigate crime and to improve incident response with live access. Footage, which only the Met will have access to, will be retained for 31 days to support police investigations. TfL will also gather feedback from customers and stakeholders throughout the trial to assess the feeling of safety and security for customers using the bus network. TfL is committed to making the network a safe space for everyone and the expansion of CCTV is an important part of this programme of work.   

TfL has been a longstanding supporter of White Ribbon Day, a global movement to end male violence against women and girls. This White Ribbon Day, TfL has partnered with Tottenham Hotspur F.C, Fulham F.C and Crystal Palace F.C to raise awareness of this important topic and to make it clear that gender-based violence and harassment is not tolerated. The clubs' top players have filmed messages focusing on providing information on bystander interventions, with content set to be shared on TfL social media from 25 November and over the 16 days of action. The three clubs will also feature TfL bystander intervention advertising within the stadium for November and December. TfL has also displayed white ribbons on its Piccadilly and Northern Line trains and trams, and the Cable Car LED lights have been changed to white in support of White Ribbon Day.  

TfL is working hard to make the transport network safer in a variety of ways, with the introduction of mobile coverage across the Tube and Elizabeth line - including within tunnels - allowing people to stay connected while on the move. Large sections of central London now have coverage, and work is underway to expand coverage along the Northern, Victoria, and Piccadilly lines in the coming months.  

As part of the Mayor's strategy to end violence against women and girls, TfL and the Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime (MOPAC) have also worked with 'We Made That' and carried out women's safety audits in the boroughs of Hillingdon, Lambeth, Westminster, Waltham Forest and Brent. More than 70 audits have been completed by 50 women. Women's safety audits help to better understand the perceptions and experiences of women, girls and gender diverse people in their use of public spaces and what is needed to make them safer and to feel safer. TfL and MOPAC are reviewing the findings to consider how audits can used to plan, design and manage public spaces.   

Deputy Mayor for Transport, Seb Dance said: ""Everyone deserves to feel safe and be safe at all times when travelling around London and it is the Mayor's top priority to ensure the transport network is a safe and low-crime environment. That's why I welcome this trial of CCTV at bus shelters, which will improve safety for women and girls and ensure they can travel with confidence. 

""Increased CCTV will help to ensure the network is secure and welcoming round the clock, supporting the Mayor's aim to continue building a safer London for everyone."" 

Siwan Hayward, TfL's Director of Security, Policing and Enforcement, said: ""At Tfl, we are committed to playing our full part in ending violence against women and girls. We want women and girls to be safe and feel safe, and for the TfL network to be a beacon of safety for everyone, day and night. CCTV plays a crucial role in both preventing crime and antisocial behaviour, and investigating incidents. We know the presence of CCTV and other security measures improves confidence to travel and use public transport, which is why we are expanding our already extensive CCTV network. This is one of many measures we are putting in place, alongside our work with the Met and BTP, to improve the safety and security of people travelling on public transport."" 

Met Commander, Ben Russell said: ""The Met is determined to make London safer, working with our partners to ensure every woman and girl feels safe in the city they call home.  

""This pilot will help protect women and girls, meaning they can enjoy safer spaces across the capital. It also aims to help us bring more dangerous predators to justice, with CCTV being used as a key tool as part of our investigations.""    

Michael Roberts, CEO of London TravelWatch, said: ""London TravelWatch research tells us that many people can feel unsafe when waiting for buses, particularly women and girls. This important and valuable trial will not only help detect crime, but will also ensure that women and girls can feel safer and more confident when travelling by bus. 

""We look forward to seeing the results of this pilot and for further initiatives to improve safety on London transport.""",0.303063386974753,Mon,0.94,1.24,1.06,1.01,NA,NA,0.92,0.95,0.84,1.010752688172043,1.027979274611399,1.004739336492891,1.0189155107187895,NA,NA,0.9912457912457913,0.9844559585492227,0.9696969696969697,0.9942824471126357,1.0614841806929263,1.0236867862969006,1.0161794697484705,NA,NA,1.0675029400235203,0.994270435446906,0.9808233188442853
2024-11-26,Nov," TfL outlines package of charges, discounts and exemptions for Silvertown and Blackwall tunnels","TfL Board to decide on package of initial charges, discounts and exemptions at meeting on 4 December 
 
 




 ""TfL's proposed package of concessions, exemptions and discounts will support Londoners in a variety of ways, including those on the lowest incomes, and help local residents take full advantage of the new bus and cycle connections""
 
 Sadiq Khan
 The Mayor of London
 


 
Recent consultation saw more than 5,000 responses, with a range of views taken into account
User charges have been planned since proposals for the new tunnel were first developed in 2012, and are needed to manage traffic, pay back construction costs and cover operation and maintenance costs
A wide-ranging package of discounts and concessions are proposed to support residents and businesses. These include a 50 per cent discount for people on low incomes across east and southeast London, as well as free cross-river bus and DLR travel, and cycle shuttle-bus for at least one year
Taxis, blue badge holders and Zero-Emission Capable and wheelchair-accessible private hire vehicles registered with TfL will not pay to use the tunnel, as well as staff and patients eligible for the NHS reimbursement scheme 
Transport for London (TfL) has today (Tuesday 26 November) set out its recommendation for the package of discounts, exemptions and charges for the Silvertown and Blackwall tunnels, ahead of the new Silvertown Tunnel opening in Spring 2025.

The tunnel charges, which will be decided by the TfL Board on 4 December, are required as part of the development consent for the new tunnel and were first proposed in 2012. As previously communicated, it is proposed that a user charge be introduced for those using the Silvertown and Blackwall tunnels between 06:00 and 22:00, seven days a week. The proximity of the two tunnels has meant that, ever since the plans were first conceived, both need to be charged to ensure that traffic levels do not increase as a result of drivers seeking to use the uncharged crossing.

East London residents and businesses currently face chronic congestion in the area around the Blackwall Tunnel. The Victorian-era tunnel suffers from frequent closures - more than 700 times a year - which results in large tailbacks, poor air quality and millions of hours lost due to drivers being trapped in traffic. The new modern tunnel linking Silvertown in east London to the Greenwich Peninsula, supported by the new user charges, will reduce journey times and help manage air pollution. This will make journeys faster and more reliable, with journey savings expected to be up to 20 minutes at peak times. ​It will also support economic growth and allow TfL to increase the number of buses able to cross the river in this area from six to 21 buses an hour in each direction during the busiest times - all of which will be zero emission at the tailpipe.

Following public consultation this summer, TfL is now presenting its recommendation for the package of discounts, exemptions and charges to the TfL Board. As set out in the consultation, an off-peak rate of £1.50 for cars, motorcycles and small vans would apply the majority of the time, for vehicles registered for TfL AutoPay. To manage traffic during the busiest times, peak charges would apply, set at £1 more than standard off-peak charges for motorcycles and an extra £2.50 for cars and small vans. These would apply for four hours northbound in the morning (from 06:00 to 10:00) and three hours southbound in the evening (from 16:00 to 19:00), Monday to Friday, or for anyone not using TfL AutoPay.

To help residents and businesses, and to support people to use new public transport connections, a wide range of concessions and discounts has been proposed, including a 50 per cent discount, which would be available for low-income residents in 12 east and southeast London boroughs and the City of London.

Bus journeys made on three cross-river routes that serve Newham, Tower Hamlets and Greenwich - all of which will be zero-emission - as well as cross-river journeys on the DLR from Cutty Sark to Island Gardens, and from Woolwich Arsenal to King George V will also be free for at least one year.

The 'cycle shuttle-bus' service, which TfL consulted on in summer 2023, will also allow people with cycles to safely cross the river via a high frequency bespoke bus service for cyclists between Silvertown and North Greenwich. This zero-emission service will run between 0630 and 2130, seven days a week, will operate for at least three years and also be free to use for at least the first year.

As part of the Board submission for the final charges, TfL has also published the report into the consultation on the discounts, exemptions and charges, which ran from 10 July to 3 September 2024, as well as its responses to issues raised. The consultation allowed Londoners to comment on the proposed charging levels, discounts and exemptions, ensuring it had been informed by feedback from the public before final approval.

TfL received 5,361 responses to the consultation - including 5,045 from members of the public, 207 from organised campaigns and 109 from a range of stakeholder groups, such as local authorities, politicians, transport groups, environmental groups, freight organisations, local businesses and statutory consultees. These included members of the Silvertown Tunnel Implementation Group (STIG), which is made up of representatives from 11 London boroughs, the City of London, the GLA and National Highways. There have been a number of consultations on the Silvertown Tunnel, including two previous consultations in 2014 and 2015 which outlined the need for the user charge and saw around 4,000 responses each. There was also a six-month public examination into the scheme from October 2016 to April 2017 as part of the planning approvals for the Development Consent Order.

The responses to the consultation elicited a wide range of views on the charge levels. As well as providing an overview of the consultation and responses, the report sets out the top five issues raised in relation to the proposed charges, discounts and exemptions, as well as sets out the detailed responses from STIG members and key stakeholders. While some responses on the proposed discounts and exemptions called for the free travel elements of the package to be extended for longer, others questioned whether the proposals were too generous.

Having assessed all responses, TfL is now presenting a recommendation to the Board to proceed with the charges, discounts and exemptions as originally proposed in the consultation, but with minor amends to ensure that electric vans do not risk being charged more due to their weight placing them in a higher user charge category, and expanding the discount for borough refuse vehicles to cover all east London boroughs.

A major marketing campaign encouraging drivers to sign up to TfL AutoPay will launch in the new year, to ensure Londoners can benefit from the off-peak discount from launch. More than 1.4 million vehicles are already registered for TfL AutoPay for road user charges across London and these would all be automatically registered for the new charges when they begin.

The Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said: 

'Londoners face chronic traffic congestion on the approaches to the Blackwall Tunnel, which was never designed for the levels of traffic now crossing the river in east London. The new Silvertown tunnel will ease congestion for drivers, reduce journey times and help manage air pollution.

'TfL's proposed package of concessions, exemptions and discounts will support Londoners in a variety of ways, including those on the lowest incomes, and help local residents take full advantage of the new bus and cycle connections.'

Christina Calderato, Director of Strategy at TfL, said: 

'As we prepare for the opening of Silvertown Tunnel in the Spring and following public consultation, which saw more than 5,000 responses, we are now asking the TfL Board to make a final decision on the charges, discounts and exemptions for the Silvertown and Blackwall tunnels. If we did not introduce these, there would likely be high levels of traffic and congestion, which would lead to detrimental air quality impacts, as well as longer journey times.

'These measures will manage traffic demand as well as the environmental impacts, and ensure the new tunnel delivers on its objectives of reducing congestion and providing resilience at the Blackwall Tunnel, while ensuring we support local residents on low income, small businesses, sole traders and local charities. Once confirmed, we will carry out a major marketing campaign to encourage drivers to sign up to TfL AutoPay, ensuring Londoners can benefit from the off-peak discounts from launch.'

Work on the new Silvertown Tunnel is continuing apace, with construction work on the main tunnel now complete. TfL and Riverlinx are now working to ensure that all the new safety systems within the tunnel are working. Once this is complete, the opening date for the tunnel will be confirmed. Work on Tidal Basin Roundabout, along with new walking and cycling routes around the roundabout and along Dock Road is also now nearly complete, and work on Lower Lea Crossing to improve the existing cycling route down towards Silvertown now well underway.

Land that was used for the construction of the Silvertown Tunnel in Newham will be re-used to support the regeneration of Royal Victoria and West Silvertown, as part of the Mayor's wider vision for the regeneration of the Royal Docks, including the building of more than 36,000 new homes and the creation of 55,000 new jobs across this historic part of east London.

Cover pays homage to the mostly female-led designs for Tube seat moquettes, exploring the themes of memory, history, dress and adornment that are central to Keegan's work
A range of artists has designed covers for pocket Tube maps, issued every six months, for more than 20 years
Latest pocket Tube map will feature the new London Overground names and colours for the first time
An artwork by London-based artist Rita Keegan inspired by the fabrics of the seats on the London Underground adorns the cover of the 40th pocket Tube map, which launches today (Tuesday 26 November) as part of Transport for London's (TfL) Art on the Underground programme. The map will be the first to feature the new names and colours for each of the London Overground lines.

'The Fabric of Time' follows Keegan's previous works exploring memory, history, dress and adornment, often through her extensive family archive, a photographic record of a black middle class Canadian family dating from the 1890s. Keegan's work crosses and often combines mediums - textiles, painting, copy art and media experimentation.

'The Fabric of Time' draws on Keegan's photographs of London from the 1980s and the history of Tube seat fabrics. Combining copy art, hand cut and digital collage, the piece layers 10 seat designs with a photo of the artist in her 30s at Brixton station, where Keegan first lived when she moved to London, with a recently captured selfie in her hand. Keegan's design for the pocket Tube Map is the first to contain the new names and colours for the six London Overground lines - Liberty, Lioness, Mildmay, Suffragette, Weaver and Windrush - which will launch later this week in a historic change for London's transport network. Like its predecessors, the map will also show all available toilets on the network.

The work holds multiple moments and histories in one image, bringing a personal record into public view and the significance of place and history. The work focuses on the fabric people sit on daily, an acknowledgement of time spent in transit and the things people may miss experiencing as they go about their habitual encounters. The work also celebrates the numerous moquette designers, many of them women and who were not all credited in archives at the time.

Over the last year Keegan has researched London Underground's archive of moquette fabrics to find a design rumoured to be by the late Althea McNish, one of the most important names in British textile design history, and whose designs included public art commissions and murals. This research is the foundation of Keegan's commission and talks to the connections and relationships of an artist working in a wider London-based artistic community. The pocket Tube Map also coincides with the centenary of McNish's birth. The featured moquette samples Keegan selected were also inspired by the history of design on the Tube and the direction of influential former London Transport chief executive Frank Pick.

Artist Rita Keegan, said: ""Being invited to do a piece for Art on the Underground was a great privilege. It has a long tradition and having been a person that has ridden the Underground most of their life seeing art in stations was always the most exciting thing, coming to Britain and finding just the nature of the Tube map is gorgeous. So yes, this has been a great experience.""

Justine Simons OBE, Deputy Mayor for Culture and the Creative Industries, said: ""It's great to see Rita Keegan's artwork brought to life on the cover of the 40th edition of TfL's pocket Tube map. As the first map to include the new names of the London Overground lines, it is fitting that this cover also highlights some of the history of TfL design. It's a celebration of the artist's personal story as well as our capital's rich and diverse history, as we continue to build a fairer London for everyone.""

Eleanor Pinfield, Head of Art on the Underground, said: ""Rita Keegan's artwork for the Tube map brings together multiple rich resonances, archival threads from the history of moquette design at London Underground, to personal histories, as the younger Keegan holds a recent selfie of the artist.

""This interplay of personal and institutional raises questions; what do we remember and forget, what is kept and what is overlooked in our archives, how does the city shape us, and how in turn, do we shape the city around us, both today and in the future. The work will bring texture to the journey of millions as they navigate their way around London.""

James Reed CBE, Chairman and Chief Executive of Reed, sponsor of Art of the Underground, said: ""Keegan's exploration of the Underground seat fabrics overtime symbolises the history of travel on the Underground in an interesting way, simply highlighting how time and travel are connected. The nostalgia of the fabric designs will have meaning to many whether visiting from a different country or Londoners commuting to work. Whilst Londoners might not always need to refer to a Tube map, we do love cultural reminders of what makes London feel like London!""

Born in the Bronx in 1949, of Caribbean and Black-Canadian descent, Keegan moved to London in 1980 where she co-founded the Brixton Art Gallery in 1983. It was at the Brixton Art Gallery where Keegan curated 'Mirror Reflecting Darkly', the first exhibition by The Black Women Artists collective. A commitment to archival practices led Keegan to establish the Women Artists of Colour Index (WOCI) at the Women Artists Slide Library in 1985, a unique collection of slides and papers relating to the emergence of Black women artists in the UK in the mid-1980s.

Collectivity has always been present in how Keegan approaches her life and work; a practice aware of its place within a broader history and context and that celebrates the power of community. 'The Fabric of Time' continues Keegan's commitment to holding creative space with others, acknowledging people's journeys and interdependencies.

The mosaic explores how the themes of public space, architecture, state infrastructure, gender, and sexual identity interact with one another
Tens of thousands of people pass through St James's Park station each day, which is located just a stone's throw away from the oldest Royal Park in London, St James's Park
Transport for London's (TfL's) Art on the Underground programme has unveiled a new permanent artwork by London-based duo Hannah Quinlan and Rosie Hastings at London's only Grade I listed Underground station, St James's Park.

Angels of History is the first mosaic created by the artist duo, and is composed of six panels, each measuring 1.5 x 1 metres, prominently installed in the station's atrium. The artwork continues Quinlan and Hastings's exploration of the relationship between public space, architecture, state infrastructure, gender, and sexual identity. Recent works have predominately been fresco paintings, a medium traditionally associated with historic, religious artworks. Quinlan and Hastings's paintings depict various power dynamics, class and social relations, and positions of authority playing out in public space, raising the question: who does the street belong to?

The new mosaic draws from the rich history of St James's Park station, which for more than 80 years was home to London Underground's iconic Headquarters, 55 Broadway, situated directly above the station. It was the tallest building in London on its completion in 1929, and was immediately considered radical, in part thanks to the sculptures carved into its stone façade by artists including Jacob Epstein and Henry Moore. The choice to realise their new work in mosaic - a material frequently employed in post-war civic spaces - is a new departure for the artists, who have drawn inspiration directly from the Roman mosaic tradition.

Angels of History is inspired by Walter Benjamin's Theses on the Philosophy of History (1940), which describes Paul Klee's painting Angelus Novus as an image of the ""angel of history."" Quinlan and Hastings's work centres on two triptychs featuring androgynous, angelic figures, whose ambivalent gazes turn towards one another and fall over passing travellers. The pair reflected on the angels of the Old Testament, who were ""at once sublime and terrible to behold.""

The figures are set against an uncanny landscape of rolling hillsides. Full-scale frescos, produced in Cornwall, were painted by the pair as a template for the final work. Cornwall's wild and ancient landscape, particularly Zennor's megalithic pagan monuments, influenced the artwork's barren, sparsely populated landscape, which speaks to an ecology in crisis; a future in which few relics of humanity persist.

Whilst making Angels of History the pair became interested in Walter Benjamin's The Arcades Project, an unfinished collection of writings on urban life in Paris during the 19th century, where he argues that the most perilous moments of crisis aren't when everything portends to change, but rather when ""the status quo threatens to be preserved.""

Architecture plays an important role in Quinlan and Hastings's practice, as a force that shapes people's behaviour and desires. The work depicts isolated buildings: a row of post-war terraced houses, Art Deco skyscrapers, and 55 Broadway. Post-war housing, which frequently appears in their work, relates to Benjamin's perspective of what emerges from the rubble of history. While a utopian ideal underlined post-war social housing, suburban architecture of this period helped to constrain sex and gender into its purely reproductive form, both biologically and economically. The Art Deco style of the skyscrapers was an architectural style representing luxury, exuberance and faith in technological progress.

Situated between Westminster - where the future is debated - and the Royal Palaces - where the past is preserved - Quinlan and Hastings's work reflects on recent political change in Britain. Against a backdrop of global conflict and political upheaval, their new artwork occupies a space between past, present and future, their divine angelic figures embodying these multiple perspectives to watch over London.

Hannah Quinlan and Rosie Hastings, artists, said: 

'St James's Park is a station predominantly used by commuters working in and around the Westminster area, often in positions of governance or the civil service. We were interested in the function of the figure of the angel in public spaces such as in churches where it operates as a figure of divine intervention who passes judgement.

'In creating an artwork that looks back at the viewer, we wanted to illustrate a figure who is always watching. It is an artwork that considers the relationship between the present and the past. Our angels are inspired by Michelangelo's five Sibyls in the Sistine Chapel, who have an incredible physical and emotional presence. A Sibyl is a prophetess or oracle in Ancient Greece who prophesied at sacred sites such as Delphi.

'We situated our angelic or prophet figures in landscapes that represent both rural and urban qualities: rolling hills, old weather-beaten trees, disorientating perspectives and wide open grassy plains alongside art deco skyscrapers, post-war council houses and a model of 55 Broadway. By combining them together in our artwork, these familiar landscapes become alienated with buildings taking on a sacred, temple-like significance.'

Justine Simons OBE, Deputy Mayor for Culture and the Creative Industries, said: 

'Art on the Underground has turned the Tube into London's largest gallery, and Angels of History by Quinlan and Hastings is a wonderful addition to the collection. It provides a new dimension to one of London's oldest and most historic stations, with the intricate tiles and colours brightening up journeys. I hope it will inspire commuters and visitors travelling in the capital as we build a better and fairer London for everyone.'

Eleanor Pinfield, Head of Art on the Underground, said:

'St James's Park station and 55 Broadway stands at the heart of London Underground's commitment to art and design. Since the early 1900s, London Underground has shaped the city by utilising the unexpected perspectives of leading architects and artists of the age. Through Art on the Underground, we ensure that the vision of artists continues to bring enriched spaces to customers today. Quinlan and Hastings's permanent commission at St James's Park is a stunning addition to the station that reflects on its location, the history of art in public spaces and specifically on the lineage of mosaic works found on London Underground. It embodies the creative power of art in public spaces and will delight our customers for generations to come.'

James Reed CBE, Chairman and Chief Executive of Reed, sponsor of Art on the Underground, said: 

'The historic St James' Park makes for an iconic location for contemporary thinkers and artists to display their works. Quinlan and Hastings offer an interesting juxtaposition by celebrating both past and present. As a Londoner myself, this makes for an intriguing and grounding journey to work, reminding us of both what brought us here and what is here now.'

St James's Park station is more than 150 years old and is served by the District and Circle lines. It is close to many of the attractions of the West End.",0.22338725676088522,Thu,0.94,1.21,1.05,1,NA,NA,0.93,0.95,0.85,1.010752688172043,1.0031088082901554,0.9952606635071088,1.008827238335435,NA,NA,1.002020202020202,0.9844559585492227,0.9812409812409812,0.9942824471126357,1.035803111805194,1.0140293637846656,1.0061182868796736,NA,NA,1.0791062328498628,0.994270435446906,0.9924997869257649
2024-11-28,Nov, Mayor of London officially launches the new London Overground line names and colours,"Historic change to the capital's transport network sees new signage, Tube maps and customer information unveiled to make the network easier for customers to navigate
 
 




 ""These distinct colours and identities will not only make our fantastic London Overground network easier for customers to navigate, they also celebrate the best of London""
 
 Sadiq Khan 
 The Mayor of London
 


 
Entrepreneur Levi Roots and singer Mica Paris joined representatives of the line names at official launch
The new names were chosen to reflect London's diverse communities and their contributions to life in the capital
The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, visited Dalston Junction station today to launch the six new line names and colours being used across the London Overground network. This significant change, which is a major update to London's world-famous Tube map, will make it easier for customers to navigate London's transport network, while also celebrating the city's diverse culture and history.

Today's event celebrated the near-completion of one of the largest customer-focused projects Transport for London (TfL) has ever undertaken, helping to make the network easier to navigate for millions of customers every year.

Dalston Junction station is served by the newly renamed Windrush line, providing an opportunity to commemorate the contribution of the Windrush generation. The Windrush Foundation is also hosting an exhibition within the station to highlight the journey and stories of the Windrush generation.

The Mayor was joined by special guests with personal connections to the Windrush generation including Levi Roots, who was born in Jamaica and whose parents came to the UK from the Caribbean to build a new life for themselves and help build Britain. Also taking part in today's celebrations were singer Mica Paris, whose grandparents were proud Jamaicans and came to the UK on the HMT Windrush, and Windrush Foundation CEO Arthur Torrington CBE.

Geoff Coleman from the Mildmay Hospital represented the Mildmay line which honours the small, charitable hospital in Shoreditch that has cared for Londoners over many years. It notably played a pivotal role in the HIV/AIDS crisis in the 1980s, which made it the valued and respected place it is for the LGBTQ+ community.

Rebecca Ridley of the Worshipful Company of Weavers represented the Weaver line which runs through Liverpool Street, Spitalfields, Bethnal Green and Hackney.   These areas of London known for their role in the textile trade that was shaped over the centuries by diverse migrant communities and individuals.

Alesha De-Freitas, Head of Policy, Research & Advocacy at the Fawcett Society, represented the Suffragette line honouring the working-class movement in the East End that fought for votes for women and paved the way for women's rights.

Julie Frost from Havering BID was present for the Liberty line, which celebrates freedom and the historical independence of the people of Havering, the borough through which it runs.

The Lioness line celebrates the historic achievements and lasting legacy created by the England women's football team that continues to inspire and empower the next generation of women and girls in sport.

An unprecedented mobilisation over the past nine days has seen TfL and its suppliers unveil 6,000 new station wayfinding signs, Tube maps, station digital screens and onboard train information, as well as audio and visual announcements on both London Overground trains and stations. Final touches to the TfL website, TfL Go app and audiovisual passenger information on newer London Overground trains will be completed over the next couple of months.

Throughout the summer TfL ran extensive customer engagement to familiarise customers with the new London Overground names and colours. This included the popular 'Mind the Gap' podcast series, six walking tours developed with Go Jauntly, a free community weaving event that created a Weaver line roundel and a football festival in Regents Park, as part of the Lioness line celebrations.

The new names and colours are:   

Lioness (running from Watford Junction to Euston) - yellow  
Mildmay (running from Richmond and Clapham Junction to Stratford) - blue  
Windrush (running from Highbury & Islington to New Cross, Clapham Junction, Crystal Palace and West Croydon) - red  
Weaver (running from Liverpool Street to Enfield Town, Cheshunt and Chingford) - maroon  
Suffragette (running from Gospel Oak to Barking Riverside) - green  
Liberty (running from Romford to Upminster) - grey  
Stakeholders, customers, staff, historians, industry experts and local communities played a key role in helping inform the names through engagement, which took place ahead of the decision on the final six names. London's diverse history and culture have always played a significant role in shaping the city, and it was important for the line names, which will be used for years to come, to reflect this.

The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan said: 

'I'm delighted to officially launch the six new line names and colours of the London Overground, in an historic change to the capital's transport network.

'These distinct colours and identities will not only make our fantastic London Overground network easier for customers to navigate, they also celebrate the best of London, from the contribution of the Windrush generation to our inspiring England women's football team, as well as other untold elements of London's cultural history.

'The London Overground is now a reminder that we wouldn't be the city we are today without the energy and diverse experiences of everyone who lives here.'

Alex Williams, TfL's Chief Customer and Strategy Officer, said:

'There has been a colossal amount of preparation work and engagement ahead of this official launch of the new line names and colours that are now in use. With these changes we're making the London Overground network easier to navigate and celebrating the diverse history and culture of the communities the London Overground lines serve. The support already show for the new lines names has already been fantastic and we look forward to continuing to deliver the brilliant service the London Overground is known for.'

Arthur Torrington CBE, Co-founder and Director of the Windrush Foundation, said: 

'Big congratulations to Transport for London for this historic moment as the Windrush line become a reality. Its service to Londoners will generate more public interest in the history of African and Caribbean people. The line will celebrate London's diversity and the continuous contribution this makes to the best city in the world.'

Mica Paris MBE, UK Queen of Soul, said: 

'I feel incredibly moved that the Windrush generation's legacy is being recognised, especially as my grandparents were proud Jamaicans who came over on HMT Empire Windrush. It's very special that Brockley, my local station while I was growing up, is now part of the Windrush line.'

A competition ran throughout the summer asking Londoners to get creative and through creating a poster or a poem to show how the new line names inspire them. The new names provided a unique opportunity to honour and celebrate London's many historic locations and stories so we wanted to encourage Londoners of all ages to take part, with different age groups assigned to different lines to tell us what the line naming means to them.

Entrepreneur and chef Levi Roots said: ""The renaming of the Windrush line is special to me being a child of the Windrush generation, and I'm inspired by this most amazing honour to be part of the unveiling.""

Kay Cossington, The FA's Women's Technical Director, said:

'It's fantastic for the team's achievements on 31st July 2022 to be acknowledged by TfL in this way. The naming of the Lioness line is just another example of how the historic EURO success continues to live on across so many aspects of our society. Hopefully any girl travelling on the Lioness line feels inspired to strengthen their relationship with the sport and the legacy lives on for years and years to come.'

Geoff Coleman, CEO of Mildmay Hospital, said: 

'We are deeply honoured that the London Overground Mildmay Line has been named in recognition of our hospital's long-standing commitment to caring for London's most vulnerable communities. This tribute reflects the heart of what Mildmay stands for -compassionate, inclusive care for all, especially during the HIV/AIDS crisis, and it carries our legacy of healing and hope into the future. We are proud to be part of this historic change to the capital's transport network and look forward to continuing our work alongside the diverse communities of this great city.'

Professor Andrew Teverson, Head of London College of Fashion and Pro Vice-Chancellor, University of the Arts London, said:

'London College of Fashion's new home as part of East Bank on the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park means that many of our students will be travelling into College on the Weaver line, and we are delighted to see the name honouring the long history of the rag trade and of making and manufacturing fashion in this part of east London.'

Jemima Olchawski, Chief Executive of the Fawcett Society, said: 

'This is a significant moment in recognising the women who campaigned so hard for the rights women have today. It's incredibly important that the activism of suffragettes and suffragists is remembered and recognised. The Fawcett Society, founded by Millicent Fawcett in 1866, campaigns hard alongside our members for a more equal society and I could not be more proud of the work we do to continue the legacy of brave women who have gone before us. The work of feminists and our allies is not yet done. I hope everyone who uses the Suffragette line will take a moment to pause and think of the fights fought and the battles not yet won and join us in campaigning for a more equal society.'

Julie Frost, Director of Romford BID, said:

'This week marks a momentous step forward for our Borough with the official launch of the Liberty line, a tribute to the spirit of freedom and the proud history of Havering. It's particularly exciting to see the Borough's legacy of independence and resilience reflected in the new signage.'

This new line will continue to connect our community, but also celebrate the pride of Havering's people.""

 TfL's Chief Customer and Strategy Officer
 


 
Data published in TfL's Travel in London report shows trends in travel during 2023 and 2024
Investment in London's cycle network is enabling more people to cycle, with the strategic cycle network now over 400km long, up from 90km in 2016 and now longer than the London Underground
Transport for London (TfL) has published new data from its annual Travel in London report showing further increases in the levels of cycling in London. TfL continues to work closely with London's boroughs to invest in high-quality infrastructure that allows more people to walk and cycle more often, including via journeys that connect to public transport.

The new data shows that the number of daily cycle journeys increased in 2024 to an estimated 1.33 million journeys per day, up by five per cent from 1.26 million in 2023, and up by 26 per cent since 2019. The growth was strongest in central London, with an 11.6 per cent increase between 2023 and 2024. Inner London saw a 4.2 per cent increase and outer London saw a 3.8 per cent increase, as Londoners continue to make the most of cycling as a sustainable and affordable way of travelling around the capital [1].

Working with London boroughs, TfL has increased the length of the strategic cycle network from 90km in 2016 to over 400km in September 2024, meaning that 27.4 per cent of Londoners live within 400 metres of the cycle network [2]. In 2023/24 alone, TfL launched 20 new Cycleways routes, connecting more than 600,000 Londoners to the network.

TfL's continued work with the boroughs in expanding the Cycleway network is working towards the Mayor's target of 40 per cent of Londoners living within 400m of a Cycleway by 2030. Cycleways across London that helped reach the 400km milestone include Cycleway 23 in Hackney, C9 in Hounslow, C25 in Waltham Forest and C6 in Camden, with each protected cycleway providing a safer route for people choosing to cycle. Delivering high-quality new Cycleways will support Londoners of all backgrounds and abilities to cycle safely, encouraging greater diversity in cycling. TfL is continuing work to expand the network, with construction starting in January on C34 (Wood Lane to Shepherds Bush). The route will include protected cycle lanes, new pedestrian crossings and new bus lanes. Next year will see the completion of several major borough-led Cycleways, including Rotherhithe to Peckham, Enfield to Broxbourne and Deptford Church Street.

London's Walking and Cycling Commissioner, Will Norman, said: ""I'm delighted that London's cycling boom is continuing. We're working hard with London's boroughs to expand our network of cycleways and it's great to see more and more people using them to travel around the capital. Enabling more people to make their journeys by walking, cycling and using public transport is key to building a safer and greener London for everyone.""

Alex Williams, TfL's Chief Customer and Strategy Officer, said: ""Walking and cycling is key to making London a sustainable city, so it's very encouraging to see this new data, which shows that there continues to be a significant number of journeys cycled or on foot. We have made great strides expanding the cycle network throughout London from 90km to over 400km and are continuously working to increase this number. 

""We're determined to ensure that the way people travel in London is not only healthy and sustainable but also affordable, which is why we are working closely with boroughs to transform our roads and invest in our transport network, enabling even more people to make their journeys by walking, cycling and using public transport.""

Oli Ivens, London Director at Sustrans, said: ""This new report showing more Londoners are choosing to cycle as part of their everyday journeys is great news from both a health and environmental perspective. Incorporating activity into daily life has huge benefits for businesses too thanks to better physical and mental health, so it's encouraging to see more people cycling.

""At Sustrans we're hugely proud of our work supporting TfL and London boroughs in the roll-out of new cycleways. We continue to design, build and activate new schemes and see huge opportunity for increased cycling in outer-London areas, and an acceleration of the integration of active travel with public transport.""

Mariam Draaijer, Chief Executive of JoyRiders, said: ""It's great to see that overall cycling numbers in London are going up and that it is increasingly seen as a viable alternative form of transport. Cycling can often be faster and more reliable than other forms of transport.

""It's important though to point out that there still needs to be more work done especially in London's outer boroughs and we urgently need to work on closing the gender gap in cycling.""

Tom Fyans, Chief Executive Officer at London Cycling Campaign, said: ""London really has embraced cycling. Thanks to sustained investment by TfL, cycling now makes up a third of all tube journeys - it's a mainstream, mass mode of transport that is healthy, safe, and both climate and congestion busting. TfL's latest report underlines the urgency of the next steps needed - delivering high-quality safe cycle routes throughout outer as well as inner London, into every borough. That's what will help London become the clean, green, healthy city the Mayor has committed to.""

The newly named London Overground lines and Superloop bus routes are an easy way to get around the capital's neighbourhoods and outer boroughs to explore the full range of festive fun on offer
TfL's 2023 Christmas Tube map highlighted Christmas lights and attractions in central London
As the festive season gets into full swing and popular events in central London sell out, Transport for London (TfL) has teamed up with Visit London to create a map showing festive events outside central London that are all accessible by public transport.

The new Christmas Tube map highlights 19 festive attractions in Zone 2 and beyond and covers boroughs from Croydon to Ealing to Wandsworth and Waltham Forest, with numbers corresponding to the nearest station. From festive light displays to Christmas markets, the map encourages Londoners and visitors to explore more of the capital this winter.

Getting around London this Christmas is easy with the Tube, London Overground, DLR and Elizabeth line as well as tram services and buses. The newly named Overground lines will make it easier to travel between areas outside central London, while the Superloop, with its network of 10 express bus routes, continues to provide fast and efficient links between key outer London town centres and transport hubs. The Mayor's Hopper fare also allows multiple bus journeys within hour for the price of a single fare.

Wandsworth, the Mayor's London Borough of Culture for 2025, has plenty on offer this festive season. You can see Christmas lights being switched on in Southfields on Wednesday 4 December (nearest Tube station Southfields) and the Tooting Christmas Fair also takes place at St Nicholas Church (Tooting Broadway) on Thursday 5 December. Meanwhile Glide (Battersea Power Station), London's only riverside ice rink, is open seven days a week at the iconic power station until 5 January.

The festive cheer can also be experienced in other areas of London:

Justine Simons OBE, Deputy Mayor for Culture and the Creative Industries, said: 

'This December there are a whole host of wonderful events across London and TfL's new Christmas map highlights some of the hidden gems that are happening outside of Zone 1. From Santa's grottos to Christmas markets showcasing the best of London's creatives, there is something for everyone across the capital this festive season. And thanks to the Mayor and TfL, the newly named London Overground lines and Superloop bus routes make it easier than ever to get around, building a better London for everyone.'

Emma Strain, TfL's Customer Director, said:

'When we think of Christmas in London it's easy to picture sparkling streets and light displays in the West End and big events that get booked up months in advance. There's so much festive fun to be found outside Zone 1 too, catering for all ages and interests, so you can celebrate in your local area or even explore a part of London that's new to you. With plentiful transport options including the London Overground, with its newly named lines for easier navigation, and the Superloop express bus network, it's never been easier to explore the hidden gems of London.'

Those looking to plan a festive day or night out in Zone 1 can take inspiration from TfL's 2023 map ""A Christmas Too Big to Miss."" ",0.27757539616553106,Mon,0.95,1.23,1.08,1.01,NA,NA,0.92,NA,NA,1.0026385224274406,1.0113052415210688,1.0093457943925235,1.0049751243781095,NA,NA,0.9959404600811907,NA,NA,1.0048599199542596,1.0529238243970156,1.0430016313213704,1.0161794697484705,NA,NA,1.0675029400235203,NA,NA
2024-12-03,Dec, London children designed posters to encourage TfL customers to give up their seats for those who need it,"Winners of children's art competition announced, with thought-provoking posters now on the TfL network, encouraging people to give up their seats for those who need them more

 Transport for London's Chief Customer Officer
 


 
The competition is part of wider TfL efforts to make the transport network fairer and more inclusive, and complements progress made through TfL's Equity in Motion plan
On International Day of Persons with Disabilities, TfL also announces that the Access DLR trial, which offers staff assistance to those who need it on the DLR, will be extended until April
Powerful posters by young Londoners, encouraging people to give up their seats for those who need them more, are on display on the Transport for London (TfL) network from today (Tuesday 3 December) to mark International Day of Persons with Disabilities.

Priority seats are available and clearly marked on all buses, Tubes, trains and trams on the TfL network, for anyone who needs them, including those with non-visible disabilities. A competition launched by TfL in September, during Priority Seating Week, invited children aged 6-14 to design a poster that raises awareness of these seats and encourages people to look up and offer their seat to someone who may need it more.

The impressive entries were judged by five members of TfL's Independent Disability Advisory Group (IDAG), a panel of 13 professional experts that helps TfL better understand the impact of its policies, projects and programmes on disabled customers. Winners Cecilia Lewis (age 8), Lily Watkins (age 11) and Ayaan Hoque (age 13) produced the winning designs and won family tickets to Merlin London attractions. The panel was impressed by Cecilia's eye-catching design that encourages kindness, Lily's informative poster about non-visible health conditions and Ayaan's wise words about how uplifting others makes us strong.

Runners-up Diani Dodia, Georgina Joseph and Ayah Abrahams, and highly commended Harrison Steele, Willow Bear and Sophia Croall, also impressed with their designs, and each won tickets for the IFS Cloud Cable Car or London Transport Museum. 

TfL will also be extending Access DLR, a six-month trial launched earlier this year to make travel on the Docklands Light Railway (DLR) more accessible, until April, to gather more feedback. The Access DLR trial has enabled customers who need it to book assistance for when they travel, either over the phone or online.

Mark Evers, Transport for London's Chief Customer Officer, said: ""We were extremely impressed by the thoughtfulness and creativity that shone through every poster design we received, and I know that our Independent Disability Advisory Group had a very hard time choosing just a few winners from the colourful and inspiring selection of entries! It was wonderful to see the children's awareness of the diverse range of needs amongst us all and their clear reminder that looking up and offering someone a seat can make a huge difference to their journey - a great message for us all.""

Deputy Mayor for Transport, Seb Dance, said: ""Making London's transport network as accessible as possible is a top priority for the Mayor. The artwork from these talented competition-winners will encourage Londoners to think of others and offer their seat to someone who may need it more than them. It's also great news that the Access DLR trial is being extended until April to enable TfL to gather more feedback, as we work to build a fairer and more accessible London for everyone.""

IDAG member Sarah Rennie, said: ""We were so impressed by the artwork entries. As disabled people ourselves, we were thrilled to see such powerful understanding of why priority seats are important and how not all disabilities are visible. What's more, the posters were eye-catching, imaginative and full of artistic talent!""

A customer who uses Access DLR, said: ""As I am a disabled wheelchair user the Access DLR team has helped me get on and off the train and I have built a positive relationship with the DLR and its staff.""

Another customer who uses Access DLR, said: ""Access DLR has helped me and my friend, who is in a wheelchair. They help us with making sure we are both OK, have regular chats with us, they keep me and my friend calm, making us laugh. They always stay with me and my friend throughout the whole journey.""

Sunny Jouhal, Divisional Director for Merlin Entertainments' UK Gateway attractions, said: ""Merlin Entertainments is proud to have partnered with TfL on this competition and offering family tickets as prizes to our London attractions, the lastminute.com London Eye, Madame Tussauds London, the London Dungeon, SEA LIFE London Aquarium and Shrek's Adventure! London.

""I want to send my congratulations to all the winners and we look forward to welcoming you to our attractions soon.

""Accessibility is a key priority for us at Merlin and we are committed to continue investing in facilities and training to make sure we create magical and memorable experiences for all our guests.""

The competition is part of TfL's wider objective to make its network fairer and more accessible for everyone. In February, TfL launched Equity in Motion, an ambitious new customer plan that committed to more than 80 actions to ensure as many Londoners as possible can access and benefit from public transport. 

Since the release of the report, research has been carried out into priority seating requirements, which found that although many customers are offering their seat, it is not always clear when someone needs a priority seat, and people are not always paying attention to their surroundings to notice if there is someone in need of a seat. New signage is also being trialled on the DLR to highlight priority seats.

TfL has also completed a feasibility study of toilet provision across the network, with a shortlist of stations for new toilets in the first round of works. More than 130 mini ramps have been introduced at 64 step-free London Underground stations​, and the Bakerloo line ticket hall opened at Paddington station recently, with direct step-free access from street to platform.

Meanwhile a concession entitling care leavers to half-price bus and tram travel has been introduced and ​a new campaign is encouraging new people into cycling, including those from under-represented groups.",0.32767361522864685,Tue,0.94,1.22,1.08,1,NA,NA,0.97,NA,NA,0.992084432717678,1.0030832476875642,1.0093457943925235,0.9950248756218907,NA,NA,1.0500676589986466,NA,NA,0.9942824471126357,1.0443634681011047,1.0430016313213704,1.0061182868796736,NA,NA,1.1255194041552332,NA,NA

 Chief Technology Officer at TfL
 


 
More than 85,000 photocards have been dispatched since online systems reopened recently, following a temporary pause due to the recent cyber security incident
Parents and guardians advised to apply for Zip photocards as soon as possible. Expired 5-10 and 11-15 Zip Oyster photocards will continue to be accepted on TfL and train operating company services where normally valid until 31 December 2024
TfL is writing to affected photocard customers to advise how to claim for any additional travel costs incurred while the photocard website was unavailable
Customers using pay as you go with a contactless card or a mobile device can now see their full journey history online, after it was temporarily restricted following a recent highly sophisticated cyber security incident.

The reopening of contactless.tfl.gov.uk follows TfL reopening systems for Zip photocards, 60+ London Oyster photocards, 18+ Student Oyster photocards and other concessions in recent weeks, and means that all TfL fares services impacted by the recent cyber incident are now reinstated. Already, more than 33,000 Zip photocards, around 40,000 18+ Student photocards and more than 13,000 60+ London Oyster photocards have been processed and dispatched since applications reopened.

TfL prioritises the security of its network and customer data, continually monitoring its systems to ensure only those authorised can gain access.  On 1 September, TfL identified suspicious activity and took immediate action to secure its network, ensuring all safety critical systems and processes were maintained.  TfL has worked closely with the National Crime Agency and the National Cyber Security Centre throughout this process and notified the Information Commissioner's Office.

As part of the measures implemented to deal with the incident, TfL took the difficult decision to temporarily restrict access to customers' contactless journey history while it undertook important security checks. With this reinstated, customers and TfL's customer services teams can now access both Oyster and contactless journey history, correct incomplete journeys and process service delay refunds if required.

Customers are warned that due to the expected backlog, there will be some delays in contacting TfL's customer services and/or receiving a final response. Customers are therefore advised to log into their online account to review their account first to see whether they can correct incomplete journeys and request refunds that way.

As previously announced, TfL intends to refund customers who have paid more for their travel than they should have due to TfL not being able to accept new photocard applications. TfL will be refunding all pay as you go journeys made by students who were unable to submit an application for a 16+ or an 18+ Student photocard due to them not being accepted and have now applied for a photocard. These will apply from when their term started to when their photocard was dispatched.

TfL will also refund all journeys for anyone who has applied for a 60+ London Oyster photocard between the date they turned 60, and when their card was dispatched. TfL is in the process of writing to customers who have successfully applied for a new photocard to explain the criteria for refunds and how to apply for these.

Shashi Verma, Chief Technology Officer at TfL, said: ""We're pleased that customers can now access their contactless journey history again, meaning that all TfL fares services impacted by the recent cyber incident are now reinstated. We apologise for any inconvenience that this incident has caused our customers.

""We are now able to process contactless and Oyster refunds for those requiring them, though customers should anticipate there may be some delays due to the expected backlog. We have also contacted all new photocard customers who were impacted by not being able to apply for their new photocard. I want to also personally thank our engineers and customer services teams who have worked hard during this incident to support customers and restore services.""

As previously announced, TfL and train operating companies across London continue to accept expired 5-10 and 11-15 Zip Oyster photocards, where they are normally valid, in light of the cyber security incident until 31 December 2024. This gives expired Zip photocard holders plenty of time to apply for their new concession photocard. Parents and guardians of those with expired Zip photocards are encouraged to apply as soon as possible for a new photocard for their children or dependent to help ensure that they are ready to use in the New Year. Expired photocards will not be accepted for travel on TfL or train operating company services from 1 January 2025.

2024-12-04,Dec, Mobile coverage on the Elizabeth line complete ahead of festive season,"TfL and Boldyn Networks have finished work to bring mobile coverage to the entire Elizabeth line, including tunnelled sections in between stations
 
 




 ""This is yet another step towards ensuring Londoners and visitors can stay connected on our transport network and means customers can access the latest travel information, keep in touch with colleagues, friends and family throughout their journey on the Elizabeth line""
 
 Sadiq Khan
 The Mayor of London
 


 
Coverage on the London Underground continues to be extended, with first tunnelled sections of the Bakerloo line going live in coming weeks
Work continues to bring coverage across all of the London Underground, Docklands Light Railway and the Windrush line
Customers on the Elizabeth line can now stay connected throughout their journey, with high-speed 4G mobile coverage now available across the entire line. This is a key milestone in the Mayor and Transport for London's (TfL's) commitment to bring mobile connectivity to the whole of London's transport network.

Following all Elizabeth line stations and the first tunnel sections between Paddington and Liverpool Street getting mobile coverage earlier this year, TfL and Boldyn Networks (Boldyn), have now completed work to bring coverage to the remaining tunnels. This means hundreds of thousands of customers travelling across central London to Whitechapel, Stratford, Canary Wharf, Custom House and Woolwich will enjoy seamless connectivity as they travel between stations.

Bringing high-speed mobile coverage to London's underground stations and tunnels means that customers can stay connected as they travel around the capital and share all the exciting things London has to offer. It is also a key component of TfL and the Mayor's plan to help Londoners stay safe while using the network. All four mobile network operators; Three UK, EE, Vodafone, and Virgin Media O2 (VMO2), are taking part in the rollout.

Along with providing customers greater freedom to explore the internet and contact friends and family, the expanding coverage will also give TfL staff better connectivity to pass on information to support the safe and reliable running of the network, as well as host the new Emergency Services Network (ESN). The ESN, when fully operational, will give first responders immediate access to life-saving data, images and information in live situations and emergencies on the frontline.

TfL and Boldyn are working to introduce high-speed 4G and 5G mobile coverage across the whole Tube, Docklands Light Railway (DLR) and Elizabeth line network, including on the London Overground Windrush line between Highbury & Islington and New Cross.

Large sections of central London now have coverage, and work is underway to expand coverage along the Northern line towards Morden, as well as between King's Cross St Pancras and Moorgate by the end of the year and early 2025. Coverage on the Bakerloo line will shortly be extended along the tunnelled sections between Piccadilly Circus and Embankment, with further stations along the line, as well as the Piccadilly and Victoria lines, set to get coverage in the coming months.

The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said:

'Bringing mobile coverage to the Underground network is a key commitment of mine, so I'm delighted that the entire Elizabeth line network now has 4G connectivity.

'This is yet another step towards ensuring Londoners and visitors can stay connected on our transport network and means customers can access the latest travel information, keep in touch with colleagues, friends and family throughout their journey on the Elizabeth line.

'Growing numbers of underground Tube stations now have 4G and 5G services, with many more to come as we continue to build a better London for everyone.'

Andy Lord, London's Transport Commissioner said: 

'I'm delighted that the entire Elizabeth line now has mobile coverage, making it even easier for customers to stay connected especially as we approach the festive period. This has been a vital project for our customers involving a range of complex engineering skills, all carried out during engineering hours, and we are working hard to bring the benefits of being able to stay in contact while travelling through our city as quickly as possible to the rest of the network.'

Igor Leprince, Group CEO at Boldyn Networks, said: 

'We are pleased to see the great progress made in bringing high-quality mobile connectivity to the Elizabeth line and beyond. Delivering seamless, high-speed connectivity across London's transport network is transformational for both passengers and operational teams, and we are delighted to be playing a fundamental role in making this happen.

'This milestone reflects our shared commitment with TfL to enhancing the travel experience with reliable and high-quality connectivity across the city, connecting the places that matter. We look forward to continuing the roll out at pace and delivering the exceptional service Londoners increasingly rely on.'

Michael Roberts, CEO of London TravelWatch, said: 

'It's great that the Elizabeth Line is now fully connected, enabling passengers to stay online as they travel around London. This is also a really important step towards making passengers feel safer on transport as not only can they get in touch with someone if they feel unsafe or uncomfortable, they can also go online to immediately report anything they see or experience on the network.

'We look forward to seeing mobile coverage rolled out over more of the underground network in the coming months.'

Amir Dawoodbhai, Youth Panel Executive, said:

 'Like so many in this city, young Londoners live through connectivity, as much in the digital world now as well as the physical world. Full mobile coverage across the Elizabeth line will be a valuable asset in terms of safety, accessibility and assurance making independent travel that much easier. We can look forward to these benefits being further realised as equivalent coverage rolls out on other modes in the coming months.'

Boldyn Networks, one of the world's leading neutral host network providers, was awarded a 20-year concession by TfL in June 2021 to deliver high speed mobile connectivity across the entire London Underground network. Boldyn  is also installing a fibre backbone across the capital to improve connectivity both above and below ground, bringing wide reaching socio-economic benefits to local businesses and communities.

Hundreds of people are working overnight across the Tube network to install mobile equipment, with all works needed to be tidied away before the network opens for customers every morning. Once fully delivered, more than 2,000 kilometres of cabling as well as thousands of radios are expected to be installed within tunnels and stations, all of which will be fitted outside of operational hours.

2024-12-05,Dec," Google Street View launches at London’s busiest stations, making journeys easier","Customers using Transport for London and Network Rail services in London can now access Google Street View to help them plan their journeys through and around large or underground stations
 
 




 ""The London Underground has always been a place of innovation and we're proud to work with Google and Network Rail to continue this strong tradition of bringing innovative technology to customers""
 
 Christina Calderato
 Director of Strategy at TfL
 


 
Introduction of Street View at 18 busy stations particularly aims to support customers who are less confident travelling or have accessibility needs by enabling familiarisation with the station before they travel
Google, working with TfL and Network Rail, has captured the Street View imagery and used blurring technology to protect customers' privacy
Feedback from TfL's Disability Advisory Group indicated that being able to see within stations before visiting them would benefit people with access needs or those unfamiliar with travelling in London
Transport for London (TfL), Network Rail and Google have launched Google Street View within stations across central London, enabling even easier journey-planning.

From today (5 December), customers can now access Google Street View within 18 stations across the Tube, Elizabeth line and Network Rail stations - including Oxford Circus, London Bridge and Tottenham Court Road, with a further 18 stations live before the end of the year.

The project, which started a year ago, has seen Google capture 360-degree images inside a number of London Underground and Elizabeth line stations across central London, as well as at Network Rail stations where they interconnect with TfL services. Google's blurring technology was then automatically applied to blur identifiable faces to protect customers' and staff's privacy.

Providing a virtual representation of some of London's busiest stations will help customers get a better sense of the layout of stations when planning journeys or interchanging between train lines at stations. It will also help customers more easily identify key facilities such as lifts, toilets, benches and help points.

Using Google Street View, customers will be able to see the routes through these stations before they travel, meaning they can use it to plan journeys within stations as they would for walking and cycling across London. Early feedback from accessibility stakeholders including TfL's Independent Disability Advisory Group and the Inclusive Transport Forum has helped inform the project, and indicated that being able to see within stations before visiting them will be beneficial to customers with accessibility needs or people who are unfamiliar with travelling in the capital. The project also supports the delivery of Equity in Motion, TfL's customer inclusion strategy, as part of the Mayor's Transport Strategy.

The Deputy Mayor for Transport, Seb Dance, said: ""I'm pleased that Google Street View has arrived at some of London's busiest stations. Now, customers can plan their routes on the London Underground in the same way they would when walking and cycling, helping us to build a better, fairer London for all.""

Christina Calderato, Director of Strategy at TfL, said: ""The London Underground has always been a place of innovation and we're proud to work with Google and Network Rail to continue this strong tradition of bringing innovative technology to customers. By working with Google to bring Street View to our stations, our customers will now be able to more easily plan their journey through our stations with confidence. This project also supports our wider Equity in Motion ambition to improving signage and wayfinding, helping people to better navigate some of the capital's busiest stations and help us to build a better, more equitable London.""

Debbie Weinstein, Vice President and Managing Director for Google UK and Ireland, said: ""At Google, we're passionate about creating products that are truly useful and accessible for everyone, and this project represents a significant step forward in that journey. By combining Google's Street View technology with TfL and Network Rail's expertise, we're breaking new ground in transport accessibility and wayfinding. I'm personally excited to see how this recent collaboration empowers people to explore and experience London's transport network in a whole new way.""

Malcolm Pitt, Network Rail's Head of Customer Experience and Accessibility, said: ""Travelling on the rail network should be for everyone; we want to empower all passengers, including those with disabilities, to travel with greater autonomy. Planning and ensuring the best journey can be overwhelming, especially when busy stations and interchanges are involved. Partnering with Google and Transport for London to bring Street View to our London stations will provide clear and accessible information that will give passengers the confidence to travel and make their journeys as simple and seamless as possible.""

Sarah Pugh, CEO of Whizz Kidz said: ""Whizz Kidz has been thrilled to be part of the work with TfL and Google on Street View. This will support wheelchair users to travel through stations, planning routes and travel with confidence and independence. We continue to support new innovations from TfL and other partners to ensure access to public transport is equitable for all."" 

Across London, TfL is also working to improve access to the internet while on the move. All stations have free WiFi for customers and work is also currently underway to provide 4G and 5G connectivity within stations and tunnels across the Tube and Elizabeth line. Coverage is now available at all Elizabeth line stations and new sections of the London Underground, meaning that customers can stay in contact with friends and family while on the move, as well as use online tools such as Google Street View while travelling to ensure they take the best, most convenient route.",0.37023842889184766,Thu,0.93,1.21,1.07,0.99,NA,NA,0.92,NA,NA,0.9815303430079156,0.9948612538540595,1,0.9850746268656717,NA,NA,0.9959404600811907,NA,NA,0.9837049742710121,1.035803111805194,1.0333442088091354,0.996057104010877,NA,NA,1.0675029400235203,NA,NA

2024-12-06,Dec, Places for London celebrates Small Business Saturday,"Places for London's estate stretches across the capital, with 95 per cent of tenants being small to medium enterprises
 
 




 ""We are extremely proud to have so many small businesses on our estate, and hope Londoners will look to their local areas to find new places to discover, things to do and places to go""
 
 Samantha Bain-Mollison
 Head of Retail at Places for London
 


 
Artist's studios, restaurants, bars and independents make up the varied portfolio of Places for London tenants located in stations and railway arches across London
Small Business Saturday is celebrating its 12th year of championing small businesses across the country
Places for London, Transport for London (TfL)'s property company, is joining small and medium enterprises (SMEs) across the country in celebrating Small Business Saturday on 7 December 2024.

As a landlord to more than 1,500 businesses including hundreds of SMEs across London, Places for London prides itself on being a home where small businesses can thrive, and is encouraging Londoners discover the many small businesses providing great options for gifts, services and leisure over the festive season.

This year, several small businesses have joined the Places for London estate for the first time or expanded to new units, bringing vibrant new options to their communities. These businesses include Jamaica Patty, a new food retailer coming to Farringdon; Flowers on the Hill, a florist near Harrow on the Hill and Zie Coffee, a small business with three shops in Rayners Lane, Hillingdon and South Ruislip.

This year's Small Biz 100, an annual celebration of 100 of the thousands of small businesses all over the UK includes Active 360, a longstanding Places for London tenant in an arch at Kew Bridge. They've been featured due to their work to bring the fun of watersports such as paddleboarding, canoeing and kayaking to Londoners while organising canal and river clean ups and working with charities to help fundraising and outreach work.

In addition, Places for London has partnered with  BOXPARK, another company proud to help small businesses. The new BOXPARK Camden opened in September, with dozens of small independent businesses bringing exciting food, drink and shopping options a short walk from Camden Town station. A further BOXPARK venue will be opening on Places for London's estate close to Liverpool Street station in 2025. 

Places for London estate includes more than 800 railway arches. Many of these have been converted into modern spaces that house art studios, retailers and more, and the landlord is investing £300 million into its properties to make them thriving commercial and social destinations.

Joy! Collective is a great example of a multidisciplinary creative production house, which creates colourful artworks and murals for public spaces including schools from a railway arch on Geffrye Street in Hoxton. They have since worked with international companies such as Disney and Burt's Bees, while also hosting workshops and using the railway arch as an event space for hire.

Samantha Bain-Mollison, Head of Retail at Places for London, said: ""We are extremely proud to have so many small businesses on our estate, and hope Londoners will look to their local areas to find new places to discover, things to do and places to go.

""We are dedicated to working with our current and prospective tenants to help them grow, and look forward to celebrating Small Business Saturday with the thousands of shoppers helping small businesses this year.""

Iona Thomas, Founder and Director at Joy! Colllective, said: ""It's been great to experience how engaged Places for London are with their tenants, and to be part of the wider arch community of varied businesses. There's been so many opportunities to cross pollinate with other small businesses. We really feel like we're building relationships, both professionally and as part of a supportive community.""

Howard Dawber, Deputy Mayor for Business and Growth, said: ""Small Business Saturday has been instrumental for more than a decade in celebrating smaller local businesses and the essential role they play in our communities.

""Small businesses are vital to London's economy, and it's brilliant that so many of them have made their home on TfL's Places for London estate.

""I encourage all Londoners to get involved in Small Business Saturday this weekend if out and about. Supporting small businesses is essential to help us to continue building a fairer and more prosperous London for everyone.""

Places for London recently published 'We make Places for London together', which sets out its approach to working with its customers to support them to thrive and grow while supporting local communities and London's economy. This partnership approach includes Customer Advisory Groups and other forums to hear more frequently from businesses about their needs. Places for London held its first ever Customer Conference and Awards in September this year to celebrate the incredible entrepreneurs on the estate and their contribution to London.

The Places for London responsible business skills pilot programme delivered in partnership with the Heart of the City supports SMEs to make their businesses greener and more resilient, and supports Places for London's new London Lease which includes clauses asking for environmental data sharing and the payment of the London Living Wage. Further external support is provided via a collaboration with Grow London Local, a one stop shop of business support delivered by London & Partners, and supported by the Mayor of London.

There will be some planned works and closures that will affect the London Overground, the Elizabeth line and DLR. Full details are available at tfl.gov.uk/christmas-travel 
There will be no service on most public transport on Christmas Day and reduced or no services on some parts of the network on Boxing Day with special services on New Year's Eve 
Additional Network Rail engineering work will mean closures at Paddington and Liverpool Street mainline stations 
Transport for London (TfL) will keep the majority of its services running throughout the festive period, but is advising customers to plan journeys ahead to help ensure they are able to make the most of what's on offer in the capital this December. Resources like TfL's Journey Planner or the TfL Go app will help customers avoid closures caused by planned essential works across the transport network and navigate any last-minute service changes.  

There will be no service on the majority of public transport on Christmas Day and no services on some parts of the network on Boxing Day, including the Elizabeth line.    

Apart from planned closures, services will run all night on New Year's Eve. The Mayor's annual fireworks display is taking place again this year, with customers advised not to travel to the area in and around the Victoria Embankment unless they have a ticket.   

Victoria Coach Station, Santander Cycles, rental e-scooters and Dial-a-Ride, along with taxi and private hire services, will be available throughout the festive period including on Christmas Day. Walking and cycling routes will be largely uninterrupted, aside from New Year's Eve when roads in certain areas of central London will be closed, some Santander Cycle docking stations will be out of service, and some bridges will be closed to pedestrians to facilitate the Mayor's fireworks display. The IFS Cloud Cable Car is open throughout the festive period with the exception of Christmas Day.    

The central London Congestion Charge will not operate from Wednesday 25 December to Wednesday 1 January, with operations resuming from Thursday 2 January 2025.  The Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ) will operate as usual across the festive period, with the exception of Christmas Day, while the Low Emission Zone (LEZ), which covers most of Greater London, will continue to operate as usual including Monday 25 December.    

Services during the festive period are typically quieter, so TfL and Network Rail take this opportunity to make improvements to rail networks when it is expected to least inconvenience customers. These works include improvements to track, signals and stations as well as bigger schemes including HS2.    

Claire Mann, Transport for London's Chief Operating Officer, said: ""This festive period, we are once again excited to help Londoners and visitors experience all the entertainment, culture, bars, and restaurants and shops that the capital has to offer. TfL's services are the best way to easily and safely get around the city.     

""The majority of the transport network will continue to operate over the festive period, ensuring that all customers can travel across London in affordable and green ways. We ask that customers check before they travel as planned works are taking place.""      

There are also planned engineering works on National Rail services, including closures at Liverpool Street mainline station from 27 December to 1 January 2025 and Paddington mainline station from 27 December to 29 December. There are planned closures from King's Cross St. Pancras International mainline station to Luton on Thameslink and East Midlands Railway services from the 21 December to 29 December.

2024-12-12,Dec, TfL funds 55 new community groups to unlock barriers to walking and cycling for Londoners,"Projects will support more people from underrepresented backgrounds to walk and cycle
 
 




 ""We are very excited to award grants to 55 new projects this year and continue to make walking and cycling accessible for all Londoners""
 
 Miranda Leedham
 Head of Customer Marketing & Behaviour Change at TfL
 


 
Funding awarded across all 32 London boroughs and the City of London
Projects include hand cycling sessions for disabled people, walks for Black African and Caribbean people living with HIV, and cycling in Newham to support minority groups
Enabling more people from all backgrounds to walk and cycle is vital to building a fairer and greener London for everyone
Transport for London (TfL) and the London Marathon Foundation have awarded more than £580,000 of funding to 55 new projects run by community groups as part of the Walking and Cycling Grants (WCGL) programme.

Each investment will make a difference to communities across the capital, funding local organisations to deliver projects that get more Londoners walking and cycling. More than £328,000 of the funding has been awarded to 134 existing projects, to continue their important work in the community.

WCGL aims to make walking and cycling more representative of London's diverse communities, with successful projects targeting a wide range of traditionally underrepresented backgrounds. These include those from minority ethnic backgrounds, those living with disabilities, people on low income, homeless people, refugees, asylum seekers and people from the LGBTQ+ community.

The projects aim to improve participants' confidence in walking and cycling in London, while enabling people to connect with their local communities, learn new skills, and improve their physical and mental health.

They will also help to break down the barriers that prevent people from getting active and ensure everyone in the capital can enjoy the health and economic benefits of walking and cycling.

Newly funded projects include:

London Hand Cycling Club run by Regain the Trust for Sports Tetraplegics.
Positive Black Hikers by River House Trust: bi-weekly walks for Black African and Caribbean people living with HIV.
Babes on Bikes (BOB) by Future Challenges: Empowers ethnic minority groups, LGBTQ+ people, and women to cycle.
Positive Cycles by Single Homeless Project: Mechanics sessions and monthly cycling trips for young people experiencing homelessness.
Silver Cycling by Wheely Tots: Professional cycling sessions for adults over 60 to improve health and reduce social isolation.
Motion Makers by Creative and Connected Communities: Walking and cycling to support ethnic minority groups, disadvantaged individuals, and young people to improve health and well-being.
BAME Women's Bicycling Initiative by Newham African Initiative Development: Supports ethnic minority groups, women, refugees, and asylum seekers to cycle.
Re/Walk by InspiralLondon CIC: Themed walks to support cultural exchange and environmental awareness among ethnic minority groups and those with non-physical health issues.
The Furzedown Strollers by The Furzedown Project: Walking group to support socially isolated older adults and LGBTQ+ people.
Silver Cycling by Wheely Tots: Supports ethnic minority groups, disadvantaged people, and adults over 60 to improve health and reduce social isolation. 
Walk the Line by New Pathways: East London walking group to improve physical activity, boost mental well-being, and foster social relationships within the community. 
The WCGL scheme is jointly funded in partnership with The London Marathon Foundation and is part of a five-year programme to inspire Londoners to cycle and walk. Since it began, TfL's Walking and Cycling Grants London programme has supported 339 projects across the London boroughs. This has encouraged more than 77,000 participants across London to walk and cycle.

London's Walking and Cycling Commissioner, Will Norman, said: ""The Mayor and TfL are committed to making walking and cycling accessible to all. That's why I'm delighted the Walking and Cycling Grants Programme continues to support these important projects that remove barriers to active travel for traditionally underrepresented groups. We know what an impact these projects are having in their communities, enabling Londoners from all backgrounds to walk and cycle, and supporting the Mayor's aim to build a fairer, greener, more accessible London for everyone.""

Miranda Leedham, Head of Customer Marketing & Behaviour Change at TfL, said: ""We are very excited to award grants to 55 new projects this year and continue to make walking and cycling accessible for all Londoners. Walking and Cycling Grants London has played a vital role in increasing representation of London's diverse communities and we're looking forward to seeing the results of these inspiring projects, which are removing the barriers for people from diverse backgrounds to travel more actively and sustainably around the capital.""

Mike Diaper, Group Director Funding and Impact at London Marathon Foundation, said: ""We are delighted to be funding this cohort of community groups across London in partnership with Transport for London. These grants are designed to reach community-led groups, at a grassroots level, who work with those facing the greatest barriers to getting active. By working with these groups, we can support projects with dual benefits, getting people into activity and supporting people into active travel. We'll be funding a project in every borough so that people across the capital will be able to benefit from a healthier, more sustainable London.""

Martin Petry, Grants Manager at Groundwork London, said: ""Groundwork London is thrilled to partner with TfL and London Marathon Foundation on Walking and Cycling Grants London. The fund has enabled tens of thousands of Londoners to walk and cycle more regularly and safely, benefiting their physical and mental wellbeing and enabling social and economic mobility and encouraging sustainable methods of travel in the capital. We look forward to supporting these amazing projects through 2025.""

David Pitcher, CEO of Wheely Tots, said: ""Support from WCGL for Silver Cycling will enable us to support people over 50 who are based in and around Tottenham to positively engage in cycling, participate regularly in physical activity and connect with each other and the outdoors. This funding means that sessions can be free, and we can provide equipment and bikes, ensuring the provision is safe, accessible and inclusive to all.""

Sandra Shaw, Director at The Furzedown Project, said: ""The Furzedown Project is delighted to receive funding from TfL to develop and run a series of accessible walking programmes designed to support socially isolated older adults in the Furzedown community and surrounding areas. Social isolation can have profound effects on the health and happiness of older adults. By combining gentle physical activity with social interaction, these walks will help combat loneliness and create a sense of belonging amongst our participants.

""This is a wonderful opportunity to make a meaningful difference in the lives of socially isolated older adults and we are deeply thankful to Transport for London for making this possible.""

The community groups will be able to use London's growing cycleway network. TfL and London boroughs have more than quadrupled the size of the London-wide strategic cycle network, from 90km in 2016 to over 400km in June 2024. Delivering high-quality new Cycleways will support Londoners of all backgrounds and abilities to cycle safely, encouraging greater diversity in cycling.",0.29193727751868326,Thu,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
2024-12-16,Dec, TfL sets out plans to improve road safety at key junctions in Hackney,"Changes would improve safety at the junction of Great Eastern Street and Curtain Road by adding new cyclist and pedestrian crossings, and restricting two left turns for motorised vehicles
 
 




 ""The Mayor and TfL are committed to investing in work to improve safety at some of London's most dangerous and intimidating junctions, and these proposals will make it safer and easier for Londoners to walk and cycle in the area. ""
 
 Will Norman
 London's Walking & Cycling Commissioner
 


 
TfL is inviting Londoners to have their say on the plans, with consultation open until 10 February 2025
TfL is also asking people to give their initial thoughts on improving road safety at the junction of Shoreditch High Street and Great Eastern Street
Reducing road danger for people cycling and walking is vital to achieve TfL and the Mayor's Vision Zero goal of eliminating death and serious injury from the transport network  
Transport for London (TfL) is inviting Londoners to have their say on new plans to make it easier and safer for people to walk and cycle in and around Shoreditch. In collaboration with Hackney Council, the plans would see the creation of new, high-quality crossings for both cyclists and pedestrians, alongside more footway space to help people travel sustainably and cut road danger.

TfL's latest data shows that in the three-year period up to 30 June 2024, there were 14 collisions at the junction of Great Eastern Street with Curtain Road. Tragically, this included a fatal collision involving a pedestrian in 2022. In addition, there were also six serious collisions at the junction, four involving a cyclist and two involving a pedestrian.

The proposed changes in the area include:  

New toucan crossing on Curtain Road to the north of New Inn Yard making it safer for people walking and cycling
New pedestrian crossings at the junctions of Curtain Road with Scrutton Street and Holywell Lane, making it easier for people to cross the street
A new signalised pedestrian crossing on Holywell Lane at the junction with Great Eastern Street, on the western side
Widened footways in the area to increase space for people walking, as well as wider pedestrian crossings on Great Eastern Street
Motorised vehicles would no longer be able to turn left from Curtain Road into Great Eastern Street, or left from Great Eastern Street into Curtain Road, reducing the collision risk for cyclists
Advanced stop lines up to 7.5m deep to allow people cycling to get ahead of vehicles at the traffic lights  
TfL is also inviting residents to give initial thoughts on improving road safety at the junction of Shoreditch High Street and Great Eastern Street. A significant number of people have been injured at the junction and TfL is designing proposals to improve safety in the area. TfL will use any feedback received to help develop a more specific set of proposals for improvements to the junction. A further consultation will be held in 2025 with more details on proposed improvements for the junction.

Will Norman, London's Walking & Cycling Commissioner, said:

'These junctions are among the most dangerous junctions in London, with 14 collisions taking place in a three-year period to June 2024 - one that killed a pedestrian.

'The Mayor and TfL are committed to investing in work to improve safety at some of London's most dangerous and intimidating junctions, and these proposals will make it safer and easier for Londoners to walk and cycle in the area.  

'We want to hear what Londoners think of these proposals, so please do have your say before February 10th.'

Penny Rees, TfL's Head of Healthy Streets Investment, said: 

'These proposed improvements in the busy, vibrant Shoreditch area would enable more people to safely walk and cycle in Hackney. It is for this reason we strongly encourage Londoners to give their valuable feedback to shape the future of Shoreditch before the consultation closes on Monday 10 February.' 

Councillor Sarah Young, Cabinet member for Climate Change, Environment and Transport at Hackney Council, said:

'More people cycle in Hackney than any other part of London, so we're pleased to be supporting TfL to make Shoreditch an easier place to cycle, as well as wheel and walk. As one of the busiest parts of the borough throughout the day and evening, these proposals are a big boost to our own ambitions to make Hackney's streets greener and healthier.'

More details about the proposals are on TfL's webpage, with interactive maps and options to give your thoughts on the project: https://haveyoursay.tfl.gov.uk/shoreditch

There is also Easy Read and Audio versions of the proposals and survey as well as a British Sign Language video version and translated versions of the website.

The consultation period is open until Monday, 10 February 2025.

TfL's updated Cycling Action Plan 2, published last year, highlights the fundamental role cycling plays in making a greener, more progressive, modern city. The plan outlines why it is essential to broaden the appeal of cycling to a more diverse range of Londoners to ensure cycling levels continue to increase at pace and that all Londoners benefit from the health and economic benefits of cycling. TfL's research shows that people from under-represented groups are open to taking up cycling, but experience different barriers, and the plan outlines ambitious evidence-led measures to support these groups by addressing these barriers.",0.2939331488936777,Mon,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
2024-12-17,Dec, Colindale Tube station scheduled to re-open following first phase of major upgrade,"Station due to re-open in temporary state on Friday 20 December

Six-month closure enabled completion of heavy construction work, including the removal of the existing canopy and staircases and the installation of new staircases  
Customers will access the Northern line platforms via the existing ticket hall and new staircases, while the rest of the station is still under construction  
Customers advised to plan ahead using TfL's real-time travel information tools, TfL Go and TfL Journey Planner, with customer information screens unavailable in existing ticket hall or on platforms while the station is open in its temporary state 
Major upgrade of Colindale station to be completed in autumn 2025 and include a new landmark station building with a larger ticket hall and lift, giving the station step-free access for the first time  
Once finished, the upgraded Tube station will increase capacity, improve accessibility and provide a more comfortable and welcoming environment for TfL's customers  
Colindale Tube station on the Edgware branch of the Northern line will re-open in a temporary state on the afternoon of Friday 20 December, with customers advised to check before they travel to the station on this day. The re-opening comes after a six-month closure, which enabled Transport for London (TfL) to carry out heavy construction work as part of its major upgrade.

In June this year, TfL closed Colindale station to complete piling, crane operation and heavy demolition work that could not be done with the station open. The closure enabled the installation of steel beams and concrete foundations to provide the base for the new station building.

The re-opening of the Tube station later this week, in line with the original construction timetable, will see customers using a one-way system through a temporary passageway to access the platforms, via the existing ticket hall and newly built staircases. This route will enable the Tube station to re-open as quickly as possible, while work on the major upgrade of the station - which includes step-free access - continues ahead of a planned autumn 2025 completion date.

Without this upgrade, Colindale Tube station was expected to reach passenger capacity by 2026. As part of the upgrade, the 1960s-built entrance is being replaced with a new, landmark station building, which includes a spacious ticket hall and a lift giving step-free access from street to platform for the first time (with existing platform humps giving level access onto trains). Work started on the major upgrade at the beginning of this year, with funding from the Government and contributions from Barnet council, local developers and TfL.

The ticket gates in the existing ticket hall have been removed meaning customers using Contactless or Oyster payment cards will need to touch in and out using the ticket validators in the existing ticket hall. Ticket machines will be available so customers will be able to top-up their Oyster cards or purchase paper tickets at the station as usual. With no customer information screens in the existing ticket hall or on the platforms when the station re-opens later this week, customers are advised to plan ahead using TfL's real-time travel information tools, TfL Go and TfL Journey Planner. Station staff will also be available if further information or support is required.

Stuart Harvey, TfL's Chief Capital Officer, said: 

'I'd like to thank our customers and the local community for their patience while Colindale station was temporarily closed and now again while it operates in a temporary state. Our plan was always to re-open the station as soon as we possibly could so customers could access Tube services at Colindale again. We will now be working at pace to complete its much-needed major upgrade which will transform the journeys of many thousands of our customers for many decades to come. This station upgrade is also key to supporting sustainable growth, helping to unlock the delivery of thousands of new homes and jobs. Work is progressing well and we are on target to complete Colindale station's major upgrade in autumn 2025.'

The redevelopment of Colindale Tube station is central to enabling the building of 11,400 quality new homes for local people. Since 2011, Colindale's population has grown by 70 per cent, making the area around the station the second-fastest growing ward in London after the Stratford Olympic Park in Newham.

Barnet Council Leader, Cllr Barry Rawlings, said: 

'I am delighted that we have reached this milestone in delivering a renewed Tube station for Colindale. I want to thank all our residents for their patience and understanding as we worked with TfL to make this vital project a reality. I'd also like to thank everyone who has played their part in delivering this major, complex project to programme.

'Colindale is one of the fastest-growing neighbourhoods in London, with its population increasing by 70 per cent over the last decade. The redevelopment of the Tube station is a crucial step to support this growth sustainably and unlock new opportunities for the area.

'While we recognise the inconvenience caused during the works, this investment will have a lasting impact, ensuring better transport infrastructure accessible to everyone. It will help reduce car journeys, improve air quality, contribute to meeting our Net Zero ambitions and support a healthier, more sustainable future for our community.'

Today, more than a third of Underground stations across the city provide step-free access, with the Mayor of London's ambitious goal set at making 50 per cent of Tube stations step-free by 2030. Delivering step-free access at Colindale station continues TfL's work to make the capital's transport network more accessible but progress will depend on deliverability and TfL's future funding position, with schemes prioritised where third party funding is available. ",0.29357260352969594,Tue,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
2024-12-18,Dec," Transport for London refreshes staff uniforms with a new, brighter look","The uniform, designed by HemingwayDesign and introduced in 2015, has been refreshed using new fabric technology and made more inclusive, with brighter colours and increased functionality for frontline staff
 
 




 ""This new uniform brings all our TfL teams together, showing we are united in our work to help the millions of people who travel on our services to get across the city as quickly and smoothly as possible.""
 
 Claire Mann
 TfL's Chief Operating Officer
 


 
New design will be rolled out across Transport for London (TfL), including the Elizabeth line and London Overground, starting with London Underground, the Lost Property Office, TfL Visitor Centres and the Docklands Light Railway (DLR) from December 2024
Transport for London (TfL) is refreshing the uniform that thousands of its staff wear across the network to help make staff more easily identifiable to customers, especially in busier stations.

The new look uniforms, that customers will start to see some staff wearing in the coming weeks, are a refresh of the uniform design first introduced in 2015 by HemingwayDesign. The refreshed design, supplied by uniform provider Cooneen, has brighter roundels representing each mode or team on the overcoat and fleecington jacket and on accessories such as hats, scarves and ties. The larger, brighter roundels will provide improved contrast and visibility - a key point in feedback on the current uniform design from visually impaired customers. Non-mode specific roundels will also be visible on other items, such as trousers and skirts. 

To make the uniform as inclusive as possible, TfL used staff feedback on the current uniform to inform the changes, which include using softer yet durable fabrics. The new viscose blend fabric in the trousers, shorts and skirts was chosen for its breathable qualities, while still draping well. The refreshed design has improved functionality to help all colleagues working across the network, including those experiencing common symptoms of Menopause, such as hot flushes and dry, itchy skin. Key garments help maintain warmth and have additional loops for essential kit. The refresh also makes certain items available to colleagues who require them, such as head scarves and vegan alternatives to leather belts and one of the shoe designs. 

Environmental sustainability has been considered throughout the refresh process. The contract requires that uniform deliveries must be consolidated, meaning fewer trips are made and thereby reducing congestion on the roads; and they must be delivered by zero-emission vehicles, further reducing the impact on the environment. TfL has ensured there is further movement towards more sustainable materials, starting with the jacket being made of 51 per cent recycled materials. By making these changes, the new uniform is also expected to have a financial benefit over the long-term.

As old uniforms come to the end of their working life, colleagues will have a 12-month transition period to move over to the new uniforms, and old uniforms will be recycled where possible.

Claire Mann, TfL's Chief Operating Officer, said: ""This new uniform brings all our TfL teams together, showing we are united in our work to help the millions of people who travel on our services to get across the city as quickly and smoothly as possible. The new look will make it easier for those looking for assistance to find staff at our stations, while still continuing to have the professional look we expect.

""Introducing further diversity improvements through the uniforms, as well as ensuring they are designed to help staff at all phases of their life, is another way we are continuing to ensure our teams represent the city we serve while respecting TfL's renowned heritage."" 

Brook Randall, Bus Station Controller for TfL, said: ""The fabric felt breathable and not itchy! I like the colour because it will stand out in situations where operational colleagues are dealing with a difficult situation - so police, ambulance staff and the fire service can see us. I feel like a lot of effort, time and dedication has gone into this uniform to make it just right.""  

Michael Roberts, Chief Executive at London TravelWatch, said: ""Staff visibility is a key factor in ensuring people can access help and support when they are travelling, and we have previously highlighted how some passengers found it difficult to identify staff in their dark blue uniforms. The refreshed uniform design should make it easier to spot staff and we look forward to hearing how well the new kit is received by the public.""

Neel Raura, Cooneen's Commercial Director, said: ""Cooneen is honoured to continue our journey with Transport for London (TfL). As it has been from day one, it has been a pleasure to work collaboratively with the TfL team. We continue to be extremely excited and proud to work with such an iconic brand like TfL. 

""The new uniform is underpinned by the core areas of diversity & inclusion, sustainability and will make the TfL staff more visible. It was important for us, to take TfL's feedback onboard and the feedback from their customers to allow us to make the changes to the new uniform design. We will continue our ongoing work in research & development with TfL and we look forward to rolling out their iconic uniform range.""",0.2904956502963168,Wed,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Extensive work also now completed to replace the ticket hall's floor and ceiling
Other improvements include a more spacious ticket hall with seven ticket gates, new floor and wall tiles, improved signage and historic features preserved
Customers wanting to top up their Oyster card or purchase a paper ticket are advised to do this before arriving at the station, as the ticket machines will not be ready to use until early next year
Kentish Town Tube station is scheduled to re-open to customers on Monday 23 December 2024 after the essential replacement of the station's 26-year-old escalators. The station's ticket hall, platforms and passageways have also been deep-cleaned and repainted, with new floor and wall tiles and improved signage installed.

The station has been closed since June 2023 to carry out the complex work required to replace the two escalators. Once this work was underway, issues were identified with materials used in the construction of the ceiling and ticket hall floor of the historic station, which first opened in 1907. Extensive work was carried out on these areas before the station could safely re-open to customers.

The old ticket office was also removed during the works and the ticket gates realigned to provide more space for customers, with seven new gates installed. Historic features of the station, such as the original clocks on the platforms and outside the station, have been preserved and care was taken to retain as many of the original tiles inside the building as possible.

When the station re-opens, some hoardings will still be in place while Transport for London (TfL) finishes installing the ticket machines ready for use from early next year.  Customers using Oyster or Contactless payment cards will be able to tap in and out at the ticket barriers as usual. However, customers wanting to top up their Oyster card or purchase a paper ticket will need to do this before arriving at the station. The pedestrian route within the Tube station for access to Kentish Town Thameslink station will also not be available for customers to use until early next year. Access to and from the Thameslink station platforms will remain via the out-of-hours entrance, approximately 20 metres along Kentish Town Road from the main Tube station entrance, as has been the case during the station closure.

Richard Jones, TfL's Director of Asset Performance Delivery, said: ""I'd like to thank our customers for their patience while we replaced the escalators at Kentish Town Tube station, particularly as the work took longer than originally planned due to additional challenges that were uncovered once the complex work had begun. The new escalators will greatly improve journeys through the station and are expected to be in service for the next 40 years. In addition, the station is now more spacious, more welcoming and easier to navigate for our customers as a result of the additional works we've done.""

The previous escalators were installed in 1997 and were among the most unreliable on the Underground network. They were also bespoke to the station, making it difficult to source parts for maintenance and repairs. They frequently caused last-minute station closures and disruption for customers. The new escalators are the same model as those used on the Elizabeth line and throughout the London Underground network making sourcing parts much easier and leading to a reduction in unplanned station closures, improving reliability for customers.

The two new escalators at Kentish Town Tube station have more efficient motors and drivers, meaning less electricity is needed to operate them. When not in use, the escalators will run slower to save energy. This complements the installation of LED lighting throughout Kentish Town Tube station, contributing to the overall sustainability of the Tube network.",0.22498429034447331,Thu,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
